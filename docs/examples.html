<h3>1. How to interact with the <em><span class="caps">VSM</span>-box</em> prototype</h3>
<script> addvsm([], [], 0, 'nm'); </script>
<ul>
	<li>To enter a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term:
	<ul>
		<li>Just <strong>type and select</strong> an item from the Autocomplete list.</li>
		<li>Only a few &#8216;toy&#8217; terms are preloaded in this page&#8217;s dictionaries. But you can type, and then <strong>select Autocomplete&#8217;s last item</strong> to add new terms!</li>
		<li>Double-click an existing <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term to edit it. Press <code>Esc</code> twice to cancel.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>To add a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connector:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Trident</strong>:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;click above the term that functions as the subunit&#8217;s <em>subject</em>,&nbsp;
2)&nbsp;then above the one that functions as its <em>relation</em>,&nbsp; 3)&nbsp;and then its <em>object</em>.&nbsp; This assigns a &#8216;triple&#8217;.</li>
		<li><strong>Bident with no subject</strong>:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;click twice above the relation term (this skips the subject),&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;click above the object.</li>
		<li><strong>Bident with no relation</strong>:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;click above the subject,&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;click twice above the object (skips the relation).</li>
		<li><strong>Bident with no object</strong>:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;click above subject,&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;click above object,&nbsp;
3)&nbsp;press <code>Esc</code> or click outside the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box (skips the object). <span class="smaller"></span></li>
		<li><b>List</b>-connector:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;<code>Shift</code> + click above the list-relation,&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;click above each list-element,&nbsp;
3)&nbsp;press <code>Esc</code> or click outside the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box (this finishes the list).</li>
		<li><strong>Coreference</strong>:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;<code>Ctrl</code> + click above the child term,&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;click above the parent term.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>To remove:
	<ul>
		<li><span class="caps">VSM</span>-term: <code>Backspace</code> to remove the last one, or hover and select Remove from the menu.</li>
		<li><span class="caps">VSM</span>-connector: mouse-hover it and click the <code>x</code> that appeared on its top right.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>To reorder:
	<ul>
		<li>You can drag a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term around (e.g. after adding a new one at the end).&nbsp; Each connector leg stays attached to its own <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term.&nbsp;
Connector stacking order is auto-reoptimized.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li class="smaller">Advanced:
	<ul>
		<li class="smaller">To assign a <strong>Head</strong>:&nbsp; <code>Alt</code> + click above the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term.</li>
		<li class="smaller">To change <strong>term type</strong> (specific/general/data):&nbsp; <code>Ctrl</code> + click on the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term itself.</li>

<h3>2. Short Story examples, and more</h3>
<p><a name="chicken"></a></p>
<h4>Tridents:&nbsp; John and the chicken</h4>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<ul>
	<li>Connector 1: John eats chicken.<br /></li>
	<li>Connector 2: That &#8216;eating&#8217; (of chicken, by John): it happens with a fork.<br />
So it&#8217;s specifically <em>the eating</em>, that happens &#8216;with&#8217;/&#8216;by use of&#8217; a fork!</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s not the chicken that would happen to be using the fork:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,2,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p><br />&#8230; nor John who is using the fork:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'with', 'fork', 'eats', 'chicken'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,0,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p><br />&#8230; using it for something else, as in this example:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'using', 'fork', 'for|c:3', 'holding', 'tomato|d:3', 'eats', 'chicken'],
                [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4], [0,-1,4,5], [0,0,6,7] ],  3, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extra connector 1 = &#8220;the-use-of (&#8230;) &nbsp; has-purpose &nbsp; to-hold (&#8230;)&#8221;. &nbsp;(Hover the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term <em>&#8220;for&#8221;</em> ).</li>
	<li>Extra connector 2 = &#8220;to-hold &nbsp;tomato&#8221;.</li>
	<li><em>&#8220;with&#8221;</em> (from the previous example) and <em>&#8220;using&#8221;</em> (here) have the same identifier! They represent the same &#8216;concept&#8217; or idea or &#8216;thing&#8217;.
	<ul 0="strong" 1="Mouse-hover">
		<li> over them both, and see they have the same Class ID.</li>
		<li>Remember: a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term is a coupled <em>literal term</em> + an <em><acronym title="identifier"><span class="caps">ID</span></acronym></em>.
		<ul>
			<li>In our prototype, the <em>coupled ID</em> is represented by a long number called <em>Class ID</em>,</li>
			<li>and the <em>coupled term</em> is simply a piece of text, but in our prototype it is also represented by its own number: its <em>term ID</em>.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>So here, &#8220;with&#8221; and &#8220;using&#8221; have the same Class ID, but a different Term ID.</li>
		<li class="smaller">(As said before: these IDs are only stored in a temporary example-dictionary, embedded in this web page, and not in an online database).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chicken-showcase"></a></p>
<h4>Two chicken showcases</h4>
<script> addvsm( ['chicken|c:7000104', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with|c:107', 'Na+Cl-', 'with', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,2,3,4], [0,1,5,6] ],  3 ); </script>
<ul>
	<li>We have two different types of &#8220;chicken&#8221; here: the type of person, and the type of animal.<br /><strong>Mouse-hover</strong> each to verify.</li>
	<li>Also, we have two different meanings for &#8220;with&#8221; here: the first one means &#8216;accompanied with&#8217;,
and the second one means &#8216;using&#8217;. (So we could also have used the synonym &#8220;using&#8221;, like earlier).</li>
</ul>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'eats', 'very', 'burnt', 'chicken', 'with', 'dirty', 'fork'],
        [ [0,0,1,2], [0,0,3,6], [0,6,-1,5], [0,5,-1,4], [0,3,7,9], [0,9,-1,8] ], 4 ); </script>
<p><strong>= Key demo:</strong> &nbsp;You can always add more context details, to any <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term. You do this by adding more terms,
and by attaching them with a tri/bident. And you can do this recursively! &nbsp;
<br />Like: &#8220;chicken&#8221; &rarr; &#8220;burnt chicken&#8221; (or: &#8220;chicken [is / has_attribute] burnt&#8221;), and &#8220;burnt&#8221; &rarr; &#8220;very burnt&#8221;.
Likewise you could say something more about &#8220;newspaper&#8221;; or about any other term.</p>
<p><a name="bio-simple"></a></p>
<h4>Tridents:&nbsp; a simple biological case</h4>
<script> addvsm( ['A', 'activates', 'B', 'in', 'C'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ], 0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>&#8230;as on the <span class="caps">VSM</span> summary page.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['A', 'activates', 'B', 'is located in', 'C'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ] ); </script>
<p>This is the very same example, &nbsp;only to
demonstrate that the preposition <em>in</em> was just an easier-to-read <strong>&#8216;avatar&#8217; for the same concept</strong>  <em>is-located-in</em>.<br />
(Again, you can mousehover to verify that they have the same Class ID).</p>
<script> addvsm( ['A', 'bound to', 'D', 'activates', 'B', 'in', 'C'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,0,3,4], [0,3,5,6] ],  3 ); </script>
<p>Here we added a little more context to &#8216;A&#8217;.</p>
<p><a name="bio-showcase"></a></p>
<h4>The biological showcase</h4>
<script> addvsm( [ 'leaf lamina|d:3|x:a Plant Ontology term', 'is', 'twisted|d:3|x:a Plant Trait Ontology term',
          'in|c:111', 'Oryza|d:3|x:The species \'rice\'', 'underexpressing|d:3|x:a form of \'to underexpress\'', 'YAB3|d:3|x:rice gene',
          'by|d:3|x:using, by means of', 'RNAi|d:3|x:RNA interference experiment'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4], [0,4,5,6], [0,5,7,8] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<ul>
	<li>To spell this out, it says: &#8220;The being-twisted-of-a-leaf-blade &nbsp; pertains-to Rice, &nbsp; which was modified to underexpress the <span class="caps">YAB3</span> gene,
&nbsp; performed by using an RNAi experiment type.&#8221;<br />
(Hover over each term to see their definitions!)<br /></li>
	<li>By capturing context information like this, one can e.g. use particular contexts (like experimental evidence) to calculate a confidence level,
and then biologists can rank of filter query results by that confidence level!</li>
	<li>Note: here, the term <em>in</em> means &nbsp;&#8216;pertains to&#8217;, &nbsp;not &#8216;is located in&#8217;.<br />
Mousehover the &#8216;<em>in</em>&#8216; here and the one above, to see that they have a different definition and Class ID, but same Term ID.<br />
	<ul>
		<li>Also try <strong>Autocomplete to select the intended meaning</strong> of a term &#8216;<em>in</em>&#8216;.<br />
(<strong>Click to the right of the last term</strong> to enter an extra term).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Full Story and Various examples</h3>
<p><a name="bidents"></a></p>
<h4>Bidents</h4>
<p>The trident can miss any of its three legs, and become a bident:</p>
<p>&#9679;  Bident without Object leg: &nbsp;(for relations that have no object):</p>
<script> addvsm( ['plant', 'grows'],  [ [0,0,1,-1] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p><br />&#9679;  Bident without Subject leg. &#8211; And compare the structural similarity with the case where a Subject <em>is</em> known:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['X', 'stimulates', 'A', 'activates', 'B'],  [ [0,0,1,3], [0,2,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['X', 'stimulates', 'activation', 'B'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,-1,2,3] ],  0, 'nms' ); </script>
<p><br />&#8230;and how artificial it would be, to capture this if bidents were not available:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['X', 'stimulates', 'activation', 'having activatee', 'B'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,2,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p><br />&#9679;  Bident without Relation leg: &nbsp;(or: with an <em>implicit relation</em>):</p>
<script> addvsm( ['white|x:the color white', 'mouse|d:3|F'],  [ [0,1,-1,0] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p><br />&#8230;from which the computer can easily infer: (once it knows that the term &#8216;white&#8217; (or its ID) is classified as a Color):</p>
<script> addvsm( ['mouse|F', 'having color', 'white'],  [ [0,0,1,2] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>Note: we indicated the <strong>head</strong> <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term in the above two <span class="caps">VSM</span>-phrases, with dashes above it.
Because &#8220;mouse&#8221; is the concept that we &#8216;focus on&#8217;; and whose meaning is equivalent in both examples.</p>
<p><a name="bidents-more"></a></p>
<h4>Bidents: more examples</h4>
<script> addvsm( ['striking', 'match', 'creates', 'flame'],  [ [0,-1,0,1], [0,0,2,3] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>This shows a bident that specifies: &#8220;to-strike &nbsp;a-match&#8221;. &nbsp;<span class="smaller">(Or more precisely: &#8220;a-striking<i>(-of)</i> &nbsp; a-match&#8221;).</span>
<br />It is not said who strikes the match, so this subunit has no Subject term.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['very', 'big', 'bird|F'],  [ [0,2,-1,1], [0,1,-1,0] ] ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['bird|F', 'has size', 'big', 'having qualifier', 'very'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,2,3,4] ],  0, 'nms' ); </script>
<p>Two implicit relations made explicit, based on the fact that &#8220;big&#8221; represents a &#8216;size&#8217;, and &#8220;very&#8221; represents a &#8216;qualifier&#8217;.
As explained in the <a href="vsm.html#bident-relationless">main text</a>.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['gene A|d:3|x:Some gene', 'expression|d:3|x:gene expression'],  [ [0,1,-1,0] ] ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['expression', 'of', 'gene A'],  [ [0,0,1,2] ],  0, 'nms' ); </script>
<p>Here (as mentioned in the <a href="vsm.html#bident-relationless">main text</a>),
the made-explicit relation is associated with the attribute &#8220;gene&#8221;&#8216;s base concept &#8220;expression&#8221; instead.
&nbsp;For this to be a valid sentence, the software that supports the interpretation of this type of deduction should know about such a rule, though.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['most', 'X', 'quickly', 'escape'],  [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,3,-1,2], [0,1,3,-1] ] ); </script>
<p>An example with two types of bidents.</p>
<p><a name="bidents-numbers"></a></p>
<h4>Bidents: with numbers</h4>
<script> addvsm( ['5', 'X|F'],  [ [0,1,-1,0] ],  0,  'nm' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['X|F', 'having count', '5'],  [ [0,0,1,2] ],  0, 'nms' ); </script>
<p>The implicit relation in the 1st sentence was made explicit in the second sentence: it is
&#8220;having&nbsp;count&#8221;, based on the fact that “5” represents a numeric concept.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['approximately', '5', 'X'],  [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,2,-1,1] ] ); </script>
<p>The term &#8220;approximately&#8221; modifies the term “5”.</p>
<p>Note! :&nbsp; this illustrates that “5” is not always a concept that represents ‘an exact 5’ !
<br />&bull;&nbsp; It is <strong>the idea of a &#8216;Five&#8217;, which can be placed in a certain context</strong>.
This context can be &#8220;exactly &#8230;&#8221;, and one could make that the default assumed context. Or it could for example be &#8220;approximately &#8230;&#8221;,
or a &#8216;five&#8217; with some specified error margin (see a bit further).
<br />&bull;&nbsp; <span class="smaller">(This is also why we represent “5” as a &#8216;specific concept&#8217; here (blue <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term),
and not as a red &#8216;Data&#8217; term. (See later)).</span>

<p>An implicit-vs-explicit example of measurement units and values, expressed with <span class="caps">VSM</span>.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>The simple explanation</strong> (this is enough for most people):
<br />This says:&nbsp; &#8220;X&#8221; is declared to have a certain concentration, given in &#8220;mg/l&#8221;; and that concentration is declared to have the amount &#8220;5&#8243;.
<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>A deeper explanation of the semantics</strong> behind it. And thoughts on <strong><span class="undl">implicit vs. explicit context</span></strong>.
<br /><span class="smaller">(See also <a href="vsmgraph.html#principle-4">The Fourth Principle of <span class="caps">VSM</span></a>, later on the VSMGraphs page).</span>&nbsp;
<br />Conceptually, this phrase is built up like this:
	<ul>
		<li>Step 1. Consider the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term &#8220;X&#8221;, before it is connected, i.e. while it stands on its own.
At that point it is not yet stated explicitly how many / how much / what kind / etc. of &#8220;X&#8221; we are dealing with here.
Because it is not yet placed in (connected with) any <strong>explicit context</strong>. So it could be anything.
Still, it is a blue <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term and thus it is a specific &#8220;X&#8221;, meaning that it comes embedded in some <strong>implicit context</strong>.
So it is not &#8220;X&#8221; in general, but some specific (amount/kind/&#8230;) &#8220;X&#8221; that we have in mind. &#8211; So
next, we will connect other <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms to it, and make <em>some</em> of that implicit context explicit.</li>
		<li>Step 2. By connecting the rightmost bident, we specify (make explicit) that it&#8217;s an &#8220;X&#8221; that comes in some concentration,
and that it&#8217;s one that will be given in a unit: &#8220;mg/l&#8221;.</li>
		<li>Step 3. By connecting the leftmost bident, we specify that this concentration (which also could have been anything up till then) has the amount of &#8220;5&#8243;.</li>
		<li>Note: <em>any term always has more implicit context</em>, much of which we may never even be able to make explicit.
For example: What temperature was X at? Which other molecules or impurities interacted with X during the experiment?
Did X come from a particular manufacturer? Was it pre-processed? How, and by who?
And even: what isotopes did X&#8217;s atoms consist of? Etc. &#8211; So there is always more &#8216;context&#8217; present.
<br /><strong>All these things are what make up <span class="undl">any</span> specific <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term&#8217;s <em>implicit context</em></strong>.
They are absent details, but they are still what make the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term a &#8216;specific thing&#8217; in our minds.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ol>
<script> addvsm( ['approximately', '5', 'mg', 'X', 'dissolves'],  [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,2,-1,1], [0,3,-1,2], [0,3,4,-1] ],  4 ); </script>
<p>It is straightforward to represent such things with <span class="caps">VSM</span>. &#8211; Though still:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It could be helpful to have software that automatically suggests simple connectors like these.</li>
	<li>Software should be able to generate <strong>numeric concepts</strong> into its internal dictionaries, right when needed.
(This is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/vsmjs/vsm-dictionary">vsm-dictionary</a> module now;
 <span class="smaller">(but not yet in the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box prototype used in this page)</span>).
 Because a dictionary can never be pre&#8209;loaded with all possible numbers, let alone numbers with a decimal separator like here:</li>
</ul>
<script> addvsm( ['5', '±|x:plus or minus', '1.2', 'mg', 'X', 'dissolves'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,3,-1,0], [0,4,-1,3], [0,4,5,-1] ],  4,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>This illustrates an error margin given to a measurement.</p>

<script> addvsm( ['5', '%', 'equals', '0.05'],  [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,1,2,3] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>Some percentage examples. &nbsp;(Note again that &#8220;percentage&#8221; and &#8220;%&#8221; have the same Class ID).</p>

<h4>Tridents: various examples</h4>
<script> addvsm( [ 'at least', 'five', 'professors', 'at|c:125', 'NTNU|x:Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in Trondheim, Norway',
          'are younger than|x:is younger than, are younger than, to be younger than, being younger than', '40', 'years'],
        [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,2,-1,1], [0,2,3,4], [0,2,5,7], [0,7,-1,6] ],  4, 'nm' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( [ 'Steven', 'designed', 'VSM', 'from time', 'August', '2008|x:the year 2008', 'to time', '2018|x:the year 2018' ],
        [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,5], [0,5,-1,4], [0,1,6,7] ],  3 ); </script>
<ul>
	<li>Here, e.g. &#8220;2018&#8243; is not a pure number concept, but a concept that represent a year. &#8220;2018&#8243; would be a shorthand for &#8220;year-2018-CE&#8221;.<br />
Note: just like in the &#8216;numeric concepts&#8217; discussion earlier, one can not generate a dictionary with all possible years.
 Still, one could have a dictionary with commonly-used year concepts, e.g. 1900 through 2100.
 For other years, as long as the &#8216;VSM-dictionary&#8217; module can generate pure numbers on-the-fly, we can always represent them
 with a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-phrase like &#8220;year having-number 42000&#8243;.</li>
	<li>Notice how &#8220;August&#8221; is connected to “year-2008”.
 (This is similar to the &#8220;start-of &nbsp;S-phase&#8221; case, which is explained in more detail a few examples below here!)<br />
  The “year-2008” is the main (initial) concept that represents time, and it gets narrowed down to its &#8220;August&#8221; month.
 We could phrase the bident-unit explicitly as something like: &#8220;year-2008 &nbsp;[time-interval-limited-to-subinterval] &nbsp;August&#8221;,
 or just: &#8220;year-2008 &nbsp;[specified-down-to-an] &nbsp;August&#8221;.
 The same principle applies to e.g. &#8220;John&nbsp; ❤&nbsp; 14 &nbsp;February&#8221; :</li>
</ul>
<script> addvsm( [ 'John', '❤|x:icon representation of \'to love\', or \'loves\'',
                   '14|x:the number 14', 'Feb|x:abbreviation for the month \'February\'' ],
                 [ [0,0,1,3], [0,3,-1,2] ], 0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>Here of course, the bident&#8217;s implicit relation could be automatically deduced to be something like:
&#8220;timespan-of-month-&lt;subject&gt;&#45;limited-to-day-given-by-number-&lt;object&gt;&#8221;.</p>
<script> addvsm( [ 'acceleration', 'of', 'bear', 'is', '3', 'm/s2' ],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,0,3,5], [0,5,-1,4] ] ); </script>

<p>Remember that any <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term represents a &#8216;noun&#8217;-concept. So here, &#8220;reacts-to&#8221; (after being connected with A and B like that) represents: &#8220;the reaction of A to B&#8217;.</p>
<script> addvsm( [ 'Tom|i:601', 'believes|i:602', 'Mary|i:603', 'wants|i:604', 'she|R:603|i:605', 'marries|i:606', 'sailor|i:608'],

	<li>Note: a &#8220;she&#8221; was inserted (in both CG and <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence) to make the subject of &#8220;to-marry&#8221; clear for computation.<br /></li>
	<li>Note: A CG would require the curator to insert meta-information around relations, like the &#8216;Agent&#8217;, &#8216;Theme&#8217;, &#8216;Instrument&#8217;, &#8216;Destination&#8217;,
which <span class="caps">VSM</span> does not require. Because in <span class="caps">VSM</span> such semantics would be encapsulated in (/could be inferred from) the relation-term that the curator selected.</li>

        [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,5], [0,5,-1,4], [0,1,6,9], [0,9,8,7] ],  3 ); </script>
<p>Notice the difference between the previous example and this one.
In the previous one, we used the three terms &#8220;expression of <span class="caps">PAD4</span>&#8220;, and we connected &#8220;is&#8221; to the &#8220;expression&#8221; term.
That&#8217;s because it is the &#8220;expression&#8221; that is increased, not the gene <span class="caps">PAD4</span>.
<br />So here at first sight, one might want to use three terms &#8220;start of S-phase&#8221; and similarly connect &#8220;at&#8221; to &#8220;start&#8221;,
to say that the &#8216;translocation happens-at some start&#8217;. But somehow it feels like &#8220;S-phase&#8221; is the main concept here,
or at least, after we simply specified it to a more specific part of itself.
<br />So instead, it&#8217;s better to consider &#8220;start-of&#8221; as an attribute that has the same meaning as &#8220;initial&#8221;,
and use it with a bident, in a sense of further narrowing down the meaning of &#8220;S-phase&#8221;, i.e.: &#8220;initial&nbsp; S-phase&#8221;.
This is also consistent with similar structures like &#8220;5 dogs&#8221;, or &#8220;half(-of) dogs&#8221;.</p>
<p>So we created a bident unit that can be read as &#8220;S-phase [further-specified-to] start-part&#8221; here,
(or as a more specific &#8220;S-phase [interval-limited-to-subinterval-as] start-part&#8221;).
<br />In contrast, in the previous example we have a trident unit &#8220;expression&nbsp; of(=pertaining-to)&nbsp; <span class="caps">PAD4</span>&#8220;.
If we would use a bident there, it would be something like &#8220;<span class="caps">PAD4</span> [limited-to-attribute?] expression&#8221;.
But it does not make semantic sense to narrow down the meaning of <span class="caps">PAD4</span> to a property that it <em>is associated with</em>
(instead of an own property that specifies what it can <em>be</em>, like in &#8220;mutated gene&#8221;).
It does not change that <span class="caps">PAD4</span> still represents a gene. &#8211; So there we must further connect to &#8220;expression&#8221;.</p>
<p>This explanation can be <strong>summarized</strong> by using this insight:&nbsp;
&#8216;<em>adding context</em>&#8216; means &#8216;<em>narrowing down the meaning of a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term, as to what range of possible meanings it may represent</em>&#8216;. Therefore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;start <span class="smaller">(of)</span>&#8220; narrows down the meaning of &#8220;S-phase&#8221; itself,
and then we further connect to this narrowed-down &#8220;S-phase&#8221; concept itself;&nbsp;
while &#8220;expression&#8221; is a distinct concept related to &#8220;<span class="caps">PAD4</span>&#8220;, so we further connect to &#8220;expression&#8221;.</p>

<p>(A first shot at creating one line of some protocol description).<br />
The bident that connects &#8216;<em>drug X</em>&#8216; and &#8216;<em>mg/l</em>&#8216; has the implicit relation &#8216;<em>having concentration</em>&#8216;,
because the attribute term &#8216;<em>mg/l</em>&#8216; would have been classified as a &#8216;concentration&#8217;.<br /></p>

	<li>The position of the list-relation does not matter.</li>

<p>Another list-relation. Since all <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms should be thought of as nouns, or &#8216;thing&#8217;-concepts,

<p>Here, &#8220;between&#8221; is linked to the meaning &#8220;to-be-located-between&#8221;, or in noun-form: &#8220;<i>the-being-located</i>-between&#8221;.
&nbsp;It could be read as: &#8220;the-moving (by X) &nbsp; is-located-between &nbsp; the-and&#8217;ness-of (&#8230;)&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8230; while the &#8220;device&#8221; term here, refers to the Instance ID of the second occurrence (the &#8220;device&#8221; that also beeps)

It is only a label, for making a sentence more easily  human-readable.</li>
	<li>Each child term (&#8220;it&#8221;/&#8220;device&#8221;/&#8230;) gets its own Instance ID and can be referred to again,

<p>Note that here, the term &#8220;device&#8221; (and not &#8220;activates&#8221;) is connected to &#8220;in&nbsp; China&#8221;.
So this sentence expresses not necessarily that Eve is in China too (she could activate it remotely, via the internet),
nor necessarily that the activation is in China (the activation-switch could happen anywhere cyberspace).&nbsp; &#8211; Sure
one may argue that the activation is in China too (it could be inferred), but definitely, this sentence does not say that Eve is there too). &#8211; This
illustrates again why <span class="caps">VSM</span> connectors connect to single terms specifically, and not to entire &#8216;triples&#8217; as in <span class="caps">RDF</span>.</p>

<h4>Interchangeable vs. non-interchangeable connections</h4>
<p>Advanced topic. &nbsp;See the <a href="vsm.html#non-interchangeable-connections">main text</a> for a detailed explanation!
<br />These are the main text&#8217;s examples, but as interactive <span class="caps">VSM</span>-boxes:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['big', 'white', 'mouse'],  [ [0,2,-1,0], [0,2,-1,1] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['white', 'big', 'mouse'],  [ [0,2,-1,0], [0,2,-1,1] ],  0, 'nms' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['black', 'half of', 'dogs', 'escape'],  [ [0,2,-1,0], [0,2,-1,1], [0,2,3,-1] ],  3 ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['half of', 'them|R', 'black', 'dogs', 'escape'],  [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,3,-1,2], [2,1,3], [0,1,4,-1] ],  3,  'nms' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['black', 'them|R', 'half of', 'dogs', 'escape'],  [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,3,-1,2], [2,1,3], [0,1,4,-1] ],  3,  'nms' ); </script>

<p>&#8230; which just uses another label for the child concept, and adds some extra specifying context (&#8220;female&#8221;) to the parent concept.</p>

        [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4], [0,1,5,6] ],  3 ); </script>
<p>Another template. Click on the second empty field to see that autocomplete can really make life easy for curators.
Here it would immediately suggest three often-used terms. Still, any other term can still be entered by typing it as usual.</p>
<p><a name="head"></a></p>
<h4>Head: semantic point of view</h4>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats|F', 'chicken', 'with', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>Written in natural language like that, &#8220;eats&#8221; would be the &#8216;head&#8217; or focal concept of the sentence:
the term one you&#8217;d really refer to if you&#8217;d follow it up with e.g. &#8216;I saw <em>that</em>&#8216;.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John|F', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ] ); </script>
<p>But also &#8220;John&#8221; can be the head concept. The sentence here says:<br />
&#8216;The John, who eats a chicken with a fork&#8217; (e.g. as answer to a question).<br />
It conveys the same information, but stresses another one of the five concepts.</p>
<p>And the same goes for the other three terms. E.g.: &#8216;The chicken, that is eaten by John with a fork&#8217;, etc.:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken|F', 'with', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ],  0,  'nm' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with', 'fork|F'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with|F', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken', 'using', 'fork', 'resembles|F', 'abuse'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4], [0,3,5,6] ],  3 ); </script>
<p>This illustrate that yes, it can make sense to focus on the &#8216;with&#8217; (=&#8216;using&#8217;) concept too. Just like you can focus on any concept in a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['use of', 'fork', 'John', 'resembles|F', 'abuse'],  [ [0,2,0,1], [0,0,3,4] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>This rephrases part of the earlier sentence, saying that &#8216;The use of the fork, by John, resembles abuse&#8217;.</p>
<p><a name="term-types"></a></p>
<h4>General and Data term types <em>&nbsp;(experimental ideas)</em></h4>
<p>These sentences will be clear once you understand <a href="vsmgraph.html">VSMGraphs</a>, which I may write more about in the future.
As mentioned before, the blue / yellow / red colored <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms represent Specific (=default) / General / Data terms, respectively.
(And black / white / rectangular nodes in VSMGraphs).</p>
<script> addvsm( ['duck|C', 'is a type of', 'bird|C'],  [ [0,0,1,2] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>A classification as in an ontology, or concept hierarchy. Between general concepts, not specific ones.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['duck|C', 'is a type of', 'bird|C', 'according to', 'NEWT Taxonomy v1.2'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4] ] ); </script>
<p>A classification, with as context the taxonomy version that declares this relation.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['bird|C', 'has', '2', 'wings'],  [ [0,0,1,3], [0,3,-1,2] ] ); </script>

<script> addvsm( ['chicken|C', 'has alias', 'hen|D'],  [ [0,0,1,2] ] ); </script>
<p>A general concept has a label. It could be connected to many different labels like this.
<br />It could be connected to a standardized name for it, with a &#8220;has-main-alias&#8221; relation.</p>

<p><br />Try it yourself! Because it&#8217;s easy and fun to add <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors &nbsp;(if you know a bit of the biology).

<script> addvsm( ['nuclear A', 'signals', 'B'],  [ [0,0,1,2] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>This should be mappable onto each other using some graph-equivalency algorithm.</p>

<p><a name="unwrapping"></a></p>
<h4>Unwrapping a GO term, leading to Semantic Structure Transparency</h4>
<p>Some of those very long <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology</a> terms could be made structurally transparent, as <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter|d:3|w:400,,500|x:Gene Ontology term'], [ ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['positive', 'regulation|F', 'of', 'transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter|d:3|w:400,,500'], [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,1,2,3] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['positive', 'regulation|F', 'transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter|d:3|w:400,,500'], [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,-1,1,2] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>Because that&#8217;s what a <em>subject-less bident</em> does: it makes phrases like: &#8220;Relation-(of) &nbsp; Object&#8221;.
<br />So here it made: &#8220;regulation-(of) &nbsp; (Object-term)&#8221;. &nbsp; (As in: &#8220;[unknown] &nbsp; regulates &nbsp; (Object)&#8221;).</p>
<script> addvsm( ['positive', 'regulation|F', 'transcription|d:3', 'from', 'RNA polymerase II promoter|d:3|w:400,,500'],
        [ [0,1,-1,0], [0,-1,1,2], [0,2,3,4] ],  3,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>Perhaps at some point this may help computers to more &#8216;deeply understand&#8217; and reason with such terms,
which we now use mostly just to tag/classify genes with.</p>
<p><a name="special-terms"></a></p>
<h4>English special terms</h4>
<script> addvsm( ['condition A', 'if-then', 'action B', 'else', 'action C'], [ [0,0,1,2], [0,0,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>Statements like &#8216;if &#8230; then &#8230;&#8217; have to be reformulated for <span class="caps">VSM</span>, by using a single &#8220;if-then&#8221; &#8216;relation&#8217; <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'bought', 'phone'], [ [0,0,1,2] ] ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'in the past', 'buys', 'phone'], [ [0,0,2,3], [0,2,-1,1] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>Past tense of verbs. A similar structure could be for negations (&#8220;does&#8209;not&nbsp; buy&#8221;).
Or for modal verbs (&#8220;may&nbsp; buy&#8221;), although one could also make a structure with &#8220;buy&#8221; as object of the &#8220;may&#8221; relation.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['phone|F', 'of|c:123', 'John'], [ [0,0,1,2] ] ); </script>
<script> addvsm( ['John', '\'s', 'phone|F'], [ [0,2,1,0] ],  0,  'nms' ); </script>
<p>The relation &#8220;&#8216;s&#8221; is the same as the possessive &#8220;of&#8221;. The trident is only added in inverse order, because the terms are ordered like that too in readable English.</p>
<p><a name="logics"></a></p>
<h4>Quantifiers for logics and mathematics <em>&nbsp;(experimental section)</em></h4>
<p>One should be able to express anything in <span class="caps">VSM</span>, so logical expressions are a valid subset too. E.g.:</p>
<script> addvsm( [ 'for all', 'x', 'x', hdec('&lt;'), '1' ],  [ [0,3,0,1], [0,4,2,3], [2,2,1], ],  3, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>The leftmost triple can be read as:&nbsp; &#8220;the-being-smaller&nbsp; is-valid-for-all&nbsp; x&#8221;, &nbsp;
which explains the peculiar order of the trident&#8217;s relation/object/subject-legs.&nbsp; &#8211; Still,
the trident was added with three clicks in the normal order of Subject, Relation, and Object.</p>
<script> addvsm( [ '∀', 'x', 'x', hdec('&lt;'), '1' ],  [ [0,3,0,1], [0,4,2,3], [2,2,1], ],  3, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>The same example, now with a quantifier symbol.</p>
<script> addvsm( [ '∀', 'x', '∃', 'y', 'x', hdec('&lt;'), 'y' ],  [ [0,2,0,1], [0,5,2,3], [0,4,5,6], [2,4,1], [2,6,3] ],  4 ); </script>
<script> addvsm( [ 'for all', 'x', 'for some', 'y', 'x', hdec('&lt;'), 'y' ],  [ [0,2,0,1], [0,5,2,3], [0,4,5,6], [2,4,1], [2,6,3] ],  4, 'nms' ); </script>
<ul>
	<li>Both are the same, the second one just is more wordy.</li>
	<li>It expresses: &#8216;For all x, there exists y, such that x &lt; y&#8217;.
	<ul class="smaller">
		<li>(Please forgive the unnatural looking ordering of the connectors here.
It would be clearer if the leftmost trident were placed above the other two. Here the current connector-ordering algorithm still works suboptimally).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence looks weird (perhaps), but it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re used to see mathematical expressions in that order.
Here is the exact <strong>same</strong> sentence but with terms reordered (and same connections).</p>
<script> addvsm( [ 'x', hdec('&lt;'), 'y', 'for some', 'y', 'for all', 'x' ],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,1,3,4], [0,3,5,6], [2,0,6], [2,2,4] ],  5, 'nms' ); </script>
<p>It says: &#8216;x is smaller than y, &nbsp;and that is valid for some y, &nbsp;and that second thing is valid for all x&#8217;.</p>
<p>It should be possible to make an example for integrals, or any other mathematical formula too.</p>
<p><a name="styled-terms"></a></p>
<h4>Styled <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms</h4>
<p>Just to show that, unlike a normal text-based controlled language, the auto-completed <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms can apply proper styling:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['Ca2+', 'regulates', 'cdc25|d:3|s:i|x:The human gene cdc25'],  [ [0,0,1,2] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p>Like superscript text for ions; or for showing human gene names in their standard, italicized way.</p>
<script> addvsm( ['light speed', 'equals', '299792458', 'm/s2'], [ [0,0,1,3],  [0,3,-1,2] ] ); </script>
<p><a name="extra-bio"></a></p>
<h3>4. Various biological use-cases <em>&nbsp; <span class="smaller">(Inspired by you)</span></em></h3>
<h4>Binding of two proteins which then together activate a third</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;d want to represent this on the biochemical-reaction level, then you may actually be dealing with two units of information here:
&#8220;A and B bind-to-form some-complex&#8221;, and &#8220;<i>that</i>-complex activates C&#8221;.
<br />This could be captured with an overarching &#8216;and&#8217; list-connector on top of both units.
However, it is probably better to limit one <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence to one unit of information.
So it could be represented by two <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences then, whereby the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term &#8220;<i>that</i>-complex&#8221; in the second <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence
would refer to the &#8220;some-complex&#8221; term in the first one.
<br />&nbsp;<span class="smaller">(Curation software should be able to handle inter-sentence references then).</span></p>
<p>More simply, however, it can be represented with a single <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence too.
If you do not need to explicitly focus on the preparatory step of &#8220;A binds B&#8221;,
then you can just assume that a molecular complex of some A bound to some B already exists, and you just express that that activates C.
We can use a list-connector, with a list-relation that expresses &#8220;molecularly-bound-unit-of &#8230;&#8221;, see:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['bound unit of|s:i11-12|x:this represents the molecularly-bound unit of all listed molecules',
                  'A|x:protein A', 'B|x:protein B', 'activates', 'C|x:protein C'],
                 [ [1,0,1,2], [0,0,3,4] ],  0, 'nm' ); </script>
<p><br />Or, if you&#8217;d want to represent this on the biological-process level instead, then you can make this:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['binding of|s:i8-9|d:3|c:19|t:7241', 'A|x:protein A', 'and', 'B|x:protein B', 'causes', 'activation of|s:i11-12', 'C|x:protein C'],
                 [ [0,-1,0,2], [1,2,1,3], [0,-1,5,6], [0,0,4,5] ],  3, 'nm' ); </script>
<p><br />Note that it would be interesting if there existed an algorithm that could map variants like these onto each other&#8230;

	<li>Note: this only states this co-ocurrence of not-events. If you&#8217;d want to express causation,
then you can insert a &#8220;causes&#8221; relation and a referring &#8220;it&#8221;&#58;&nbsp; &#8220;&#8230; causes it not binds-to C&#8221;.</li>
	<li class="smaller">Pro tip (advanced topic):&nbsp; a reflection on specific vs. general concepts (or <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms):
 <br />that causation would also just be an observation for a (or several) specific A and C. &#8211; If you&#8217;d want to express
 that this happens for any and all &#8216;A&#8217;s in general, then you could make &#8220;A&#8221; a general concept (Ctrl-click it).
 <br />But: usually in a scientific report, even though such a result may be based on many observations,
 it is only valid for the range of specific &#8220;A&#8220;s, within the context of the study(&#8216;s possibly many experiments).
 This still not qualifies for it to be a general &#8220;A&#8221;. A general &#8220;A&#8221; would be e.g. for saying that &#8220;A[-in-general] is-classified-as protein&#8221;).</li>

<p>This is a literal conversion of statements in <a href="http://openbel.org/"><span class="caps">BEL</span></a> (Biological Expression Language) :
<br /> &nbsp; <span class="smaller pre"><span class="caps">SET</span> CellLine = &#34;<span class="caps">U266</span>&#34;</span>
<br /> &nbsp; <span class="smaller pre">proteinAbundance(<span class="caps">HGNC</span>:IL6) increases rnaAbundance(<span class="caps">HGNC</span>:ENO1)</span>
<br />Or line 2 in short-form: &nbsp; <span class="smaller pre">p(<span class="caps">HGNC</span>:IL6) -&gt; r(<span class="caps">HGNC</span>:ENO1)</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">BEL</span> uses two lines for this. The second line is conveniently short when written in short-form.
<br />The <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence may be quick to construct when using <span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates,
which in addition supports the curator with convenient autocomplete functionality.
And the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence is easier to read as one quasi-natural-language sentence, as one unit of information.</p>
<p>Also, compared to controlled languages (like <span class="caps">BEL</span>), <span class="caps">VSM</span> does not need to be regularly updated
with new rules to gain more power of expression.
Only the controlled vocabularies that are plugged in to the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box need to be updated, externally,
and that happens to them all the time anyway.</p>

<p>This corresponds to the three <span class="caps">BEL</span> statements
<span class="smaller">(from under <a href="http://openbel.org/language/version_2.0/bel_specification_version_2.0.html#_bel_statement_examples">here</a>)</span> :
<br /> &nbsp; <span class="smaller pre"><span class="caps">SET</span> Anatomy = &#34;cardiovascular system&#34;</span>

<br /> &nbsp; <span class="smaller pre">abundance(<span class="caps">CHEBI</span>:corticosteroid) decreases biologicalProcess(<span class="caps">MESHD</span>:Inflammation)</span></p>
<p>A <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence represents this as one fluently readable unit of information.
<br />Types/classifications (<span class="caps">CHEBI</span>, MeSH Disease, etc) automatically got linked to what the curator chose via autocomplete,
and are all embedded in <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms.
<br />Just mouse-hover them to see.</p>
<p>In addition and <strong>importantly</strong>: <span class="caps">VSM</span> enables to specify more precisely how the &#8216;&#8220;stroke&#8221; context&#8217; relates to the rest of the information:
with the relation &#8220;after&#8221; (found in the plain English text
under <a href="http://openbel.org/language/version_2.0/bel_specification_version_2.0.html#_bel_statement_examples">here</a>).
<br />&nbsp;<span class="smaller">(Note that the relation could have been &#8220;before&#8221; too, i.e. describing a preventative measure for at-risk patients.
But a simple &#8216;MeSHDisease = &#8230;&#8217; context with <span class="caps">BEL</span> does not capture this level of detail.
&nbsp;It is easy to specify this with <span class="caps">VSM</span>).</span></p>
