<h2>2. &nbsp; <span class="caps">VSM</span> &nbsp;<span class="smaller">(Visual Syntax Method)</span></h2>
<h4>i. Goal</h4>
<p>With <span class="caps">VSM</span>, we aim to develop a method that enables people to consider any <a href="intro#piece-of-information">unit of information</a>, and <a href="intro#biocuration">reformulate</a> it into a semantically precise, <a href="intro#computable-information">computable form</a> that clarifies its full meaning and <a href="intro#context">context</a>.<script>function togglePopup(e) {  e = e || window.event;  e = e.target || e.srcElement || e;  var s = e.nextSibling.className;  hidePopups(e, 1);  if(s.indexOf('showPopup') < 0)  e.nextSibling.className = (s + ' showPopup');  return false;}function hidePopups(e, sk) {  if(!sk) {    e = e || window.event;  e = e.target || e.srcElement || e;    if(e.className.indexOf('popx') >= 0) return;  }  var a = document.getElementsByClassName('showPopup');  for(var i=a.length-1; i>=0; i--)  a[i].className = a[i].className.replace('showPopup', '');}document.body.addEventListener('click', hidePopups, false);document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {  if((e||window.event).keyCode==27 ) hidePopups(e);});</script><span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">1</span><span class="popx popup">
 Please read the <a href="intro">Introduction page</a> if you still need to understand why this is important.<br />Or at least read the Blue Boxes with our key concepts:
 &#8216;<a href="intro#piece-of-information">Piece&nbsp;of&nbsp;Information</a>&#8216;, &#8216;<a href="intro#context">Context&nbsp;details</a>&#8216;,

 <br /><br />See also the introduction&#8217;s <a href="intro#new-tech">Venn diagram</a>.
</span></span></p>
<p>We aim for <span class="caps">VSM</span> to be applicable to the widest range of use-cases, so it works for diverse, heterogeneous, and detail-rich information. At the same time, we aim for <span class="caps">VSM</span> to be easily usable by many people with diverse skills and expertise, which requires that it keeps the inherent complexity of real-world information manageable. Like this, <span class="caps">VSM</span> enables humans to manually create meaningful <strong>computable information</strong>, with high <strong>ease of use</strong>, and <strong>high expressive power</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="caps">VSM</span> includes selected strengths from existing methods to represent knowledge: natural language, controlled languages, ontologies and <span class="caps">RDF</span> triples.<span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">1</span><span class="popx popup">

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language">Wiki:Formal_language</a>;
 <br />&bull; Natural language: e.g. English, Dutch;
 <br />&bull; <span class="caps">RDF</span>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">Wiki:RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/"><span class="caps">W3C</span></a>,

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Biomedical_Ontologies">Wiki:Open_Biomedical_Ontologies</a>.
</span></span>But in order to meet the requirements above, <span class="caps">VSM</span> also intentionally differs in several ways, and defines a fresh set of foundational principles.</p>
<p>One can compare <span class="caps">VSM</span> with how a high-level programming language enables people to make an algorithm explicit by encoding it in a way that both humans and computers can manage.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">2</span><span class="popx popup">
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"><strong>High-level</strong></a> programming languages have for-loops, if-then-else blocks, functions, etc.
 <br />In contrast, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language"><strong>low-level</strong></a>, bare-metal assembly languages offer little to no such helpful, intuitive abstractions.
</span></span>Similarly, <span class="caps">VSM</span> is a language/tool to make an idea, thought, or piece of information explicit, by encoding it with intuitive, elemental components, in a way that both humans and computers can readily process and manage.</p>
<h4>ii. Design</h4>
<p><span class="caps">VSM</span> is the combination of a new <strong>semantic model</strong> (or procedure, or <em>method</em>) and the design for a supporting <strong>user interface</strong> that together enable people to produce and read computable information.</p>
<p><span class="undl">As a Semantic Model</span>, <span class="caps">VSM</span> is like a language. It has a simple, small set of rules for constructing information in the form of a so-called <span class="undd"><em><span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence</em></span>, which is a semi-linear statement form<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">3</span><span class="popx popup">
 This <em>statement</em> form is inspired by controlled languages.
 But unlike them, <span class="caps">VSM</span> avoids intricate rules on word order or fixed keywords. <span class="caps">VSM</span> uses a simpler, generalized way to clarify structure.
</span></span>that is flexible and intuitive for humans to work with. Similar to how a natural language consists of words and a grammar, <span class="caps">VSM</span> has two building blocks: <span class="undd"><em><span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms</em></span> and <span class="undd"><em><span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors</em></span>. In addition, the three <span class="undd"><em><span class="caps">VSM</span> Principles</em></span> describe how terms and connectors can be meaningfully combined into virtually limitless combinations, in order to unambiguously represent essentially any type of complex information.</p>
<p><span class="undl">As a User Interface</span> (UI), <span class="caps">VSM</span> defines the design for a software input-component that can be embedded in other software, for instance a web page. It enables people to enter (i.e. make explicit to the computer) a possibly complex piece of information, one per input-component. This component is called a <span class="undd"><em><span class="caps">VSM</span>-box</em></span>.</p>
<h4>iii. Current status</h4>
<p>We have built a prototype user-interface for curation<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">4</span><span class="popx popup">
 Knowledge <em>Curation</em> = the manual (or semi-automatic) conversion of information from unstructured text etc. into a precise, computer-understandable (i.e. computer-actionable) form.
</span></span>based on <span class="caps">VSM</span>, for the purpose of demonstrating <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s utility. It is embedded in the page with interactive <a href="examples">examples</a>, and we have been using it for several years at our lab for a specific biocuration <a href="scicura">project</a>, to test and experience its use in real life. This exercise has given us many insights that are now included in this paper, in which we focus on <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s full design and principles.</p>
<p>Recently, we have also built a production-ready (well-designed, well-documented, and easily reusable) <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-box"><span class="caps">VSM</span>-box</a> web-component, available in the <a href="https://github.com/vsm">&#8216;vsm&#8217; organization</a><span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">5</span><span class="popx popup">
 At <a href="https://github.com/vsm">github.com/vsm</a> : several modules that culminate in the <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-box">vsm-box</a> web-component (user-interface component).
</span></span>on GitHub. This core user-interface component and its supporting modules result from a large software-design and programming effort.</p>
<p>We hope that this work may be the start of a potentially large ecosystem of supporting and derived modules: of tools that facilitate specific or general use of <span class="caps">VSM</span> as an interface for communicating diverse and context-rich knowledge with computers. We therefore welcome the community to contribute to <span class="caps">VSM</span> on GitHub, or to create depending projects.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">6</span><span class="popx popup">
 E.g.:
 <br />&bull; <a href="https://github.com/UniBioDicts">UniBioDicts</a> : modules that provide bioscience terminology to the vsm-box component (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1065">doi</a>);
 <br />&bull; <a href="https://github.com/MI2CAST/causalBuilder">causalBuilder</a> : web app that uses a vsm-box to support curation of molecular causal interactions (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaa107">doi</a>).
</span></span></p>
<h4>iv. Caveat</h4>
<p>The design of <span class="caps">VSM</span> incorporates several ideas from existing technologies, but it also includes significant differences. As such, we have repeatedly experienced that experts with backgrounds in related areas are prone to make initial assumptions that cause misunderstanding of key concepts of <span class="caps">VSM</span>. In what follows, we hope to preempt such assumptions through extensive clarifications, yet we would like to advise readers familiar with related KR technologies to be especially mindful of the intentional differences.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">7</span><span class="popx popup">
 Still, a mapping between <span class="caps">VSM</span> and existing technologies is one of our active research interests.
 <br />As one connection, see a proposed conversion to <span class="caps">RDF</span>: <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-to-rdf">vsm-to-rdf</a>.
</span></span></p>
<h4>v. Approach of this text</h4>
<p><span class="caps">VSM</span> is a practical way of constructing meaning, inspired by human thinking; i.e. it combines a focus on human usability, with a particular view on semantics. For most of <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s intended audience, the prime interest will likely be its usability aspect. Therefore, we have written this <span class="caps">VSM</span> paper mostly from that perspective. Each of the semantic principles that make <span class="caps">VSM</span> work, are introduced starting from the perspective of usability, inspired by how humans/curators are used to think. Further elaboration on <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s semantics from a mathematical or formal-logic perspective, technical implementations of its user interface, etc., will be described in specialized publications.</p>
<p>While <span class="caps">VSM</span> was initially designed to solve a problem in the biosciences, we believe that <span class="caps">VSM</span> is much more generally applicable. Therefore, in what follows, we often use and start from domain-neutral examples.</p>
<p>For a quick overview: just read the &#8216;Short&nbsp;Story&#8217; texts (yellow boxes); these introduce the ideas in informal language.
For a deeper explanation and detailed justifications of design choices: read the &#8216;Full&nbsp;Story&#8217; texts.</p>

<a name="vsm-terms"></a></p>
<h2>1. <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms</h2>
<p><span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms are like the words of a language. But they are clearer (not ambiguous).</p>
<div class="shortstory">
<h4>The Short Story <span class="ssr">1/5</span></h4>
<p>This is a screenshot of the user interface: an input component called a <em><span class="caps">VSM</span>-box</em> :</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm01-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you type a word in it, you get an <em>autocomplete list</em>.
It offers terms from one or more pre-loaded <em>dictionaries</em>, i.e. lists of words for which people already agreed on a precise definition. &#8211; This
example just uses a toy-dictionary called Persons:<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">8</span><span class="popx popup">
 To use a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box in a real application, it must be linked to some dictionary/ies, e.g. some of the many available
 biological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Biomedical_Ontologies">Ontologies</a>
 (like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25214827">on</a> <a href="https://bioportal.bioontology.org/">BioPortal</a>)
 or  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary">Controlled Vocabularies</a> (CV).
 <br /><br />Also, these CVs are often incomplete works-in-progress, so you may need to create extra terms, or even new dictionaries, for your research field.
 <br />It is an essential step anyway for communicating with colleagues, to agree on what words mean what!
 Building an agreed-upon dictionary just formalizes this process and creates a common work of reference.
</span></span></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm01-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then by selecting an item from the list, you enter a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term: &#8230;</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm01-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>&#8230; and the computer knows exactly which John you talk about,
because the blue term is linked to an ID (an identifier, a representative long number) that the computer can use for computation.</p>
<p>To check a term&#8217;s definition and ID, you can mouse-hover or tap it:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm01-4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Next, you can add more <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms. A cool thing is that this works like Facebook search:
if you have two friends with the same name, it&#8217;s no problem: the autocomplete shows extra information (photo, city) to help you choose the right one. &#8211; Likewise,
a <span class="caps">VSM</span> UI helps you disambiguate between terms from multiple dictionaries. Here we select what kind of &#8216;chicken&#8217; we mean:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm01-5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>and what kind of &#8216;with&#8217; we mean:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm01-6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the end we create a human-readable sequence of words, with 5 terms that are each linked to an unambiguous ID:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm01-7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Note: each blue <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term is always a <strong>specific</strong> &#8216;thing&#8217;.
So it&#8217;s <em>not Johns in general</em>, but <em>a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;John</em>, in a particular situation.
This is because we&#8217;re capturing information embedded in a context &#8211; e.g.
the specific observation that some entity behaved in some way in some particular situation / experiment.</p>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll have to clarify to the computer how these 5 terms hang together, i.e. the syntax of the sentence. &#8211; But
that&#8217;s for after the Full Story on <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms, if you like :</p>

</div>
<h4>The Full Story &nbsp;<span class="smaller">(formal story)</span></h4>
<p>We will use a <i><span class="caps">VSM</span>-box</i> as the setting in which we introduce both the semantic model and the user-interaction design of <span class="caps">VSM</span>.</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box, the user-interface of <span class="caps">VSM</span>, supports the entering of <i><span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms</i> via an autocomplete function, by way of a drop-down list that lets users select the specific term that matches the concept they want to define (Fig. 1a). Each shown, entered <i><strong><span class="caps">VSM</span>-term</strong></i> (blue rectangle with text, as a user-interface element) represents a single <strong>concept</strong><span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">2</span><span class="popx popup">
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept">Wikipedia:Concept</a>
</span></span>,
or a <i>unit of meaning</i>, represented by a <strong>term</strong> (i.e. term-string). A term can consist of one or more words, for instance &#8220;homo sapiens&#8221;, &#8220;is located in&#8221;, or &#8220;binds to&#8221;. A term is in fact a human-friendly representation of a unique <strong>identifier</strong> (ID): a number or code that computers work with. Each term and its linked ID ideally come from an authoritative list, whose purpose it is to unambiguously define the meaning of each of its member terms, and to give it a unique ID together with known synonyms and other information. Such a list can be a domain ontology (e.g. Gene Ontology), a controlled vocabulary (CV) (e.g. <span class="caps">PSI</span>-MI), a list of entities (e.g. genes, <span class="caps">NCBI</span> Gene), or a curator-built list (e.g. via PubDictionaries).<span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">3</span><span class="popx popup">

</span></span><br />A <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box UI-component – which is meant to be embedded in other software – needs to be linked to one or more external term-lists or <i>dictionaries</i> like these, to give the user access to available terminology and IDs.</p>
<p>It can often happen that a same term is present in multiple lists and therefore linked to multiple IDs. The autocomplete function therefore helps the user to disambiguate between the available concepts or IDs. For example, for a human, a mouse, and a chicken gene with the same name, the autocomplete selection panel would suggest all three names together with the species of each. Once the intended term+ID couple is selected, only the term remains visible to the user (by default), while the ID is stored in the background, by the software or curation system. The UI may still show full information when mouse-hovering a term, or it could display a clarifying icon, or use other customizations.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">9</span><span class="popx popup">
 Here we discuss features for the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box UI that are either implemented or that are ideas for customization options or extensions. We refer to the <a href="https://github.com/vsm">&#8216;vsm&#8217; organization</a> on GitHub (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-box">vsm-box</a>) to follow up on which features are currently available.
 <br />Note: the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box UI embedded in the Short Stories here and on the Examples page, is just the prototype.
 <br />The <a href="https://vsm.github.io/demo">vsm demo</a> page includes the refactored, &#8216;production ready&#8217; vsm-box user-interface component.
</span></span></p>
<p>In addition to supporting the above-mentioned terms with multiple meanings, or <strong>homonyms</strong>, a <span class="caps">VSM</span> UI also supports <strong>synonyms</strong>, i.e.: different terms may be used to represent a same concept. This enhances user-friendliness in several ways.<span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">4</span><span class="popx popup">

<span class="undl">First</span>, it enables <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences to correspond better to the text of the publication that is curated, because for example: gene and ontology terms often have many synonyms that are frequently used in the biological literature. When curating, synonyms (linked to the correct ID) make it easier to mentally map a long curated <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence onto terminology used in the publication, especially for other curators who may double-check the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence. If needed, one can still add a UI-option to switch to displaying terms by their main, official name. –
<span class="undl">Second</span>, some official terms may be excessively long (e.g. in GO<span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">5</span><span class="popx popup">
 Gene Ontology (<a href="http://www.geneontology.org">geneontology.org</a>) includes a dictionary (controlled vocabulary) of terms about gene functionality etc. &#8211; Example of a long term:
 &#8220;<a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045944">positive regulation of transcription from <span class="caps">RNA</span> polymerase II promoter</a>&#8220;, many are longer. This length originates from GO being designed as a label-based classification system for biological concepts, resulting in a deep tree structure of ever-more-specific terminology.
</span></span>),
and curators may prefer to use an available abbreviation to keep produced statements readable. –
<span class="undl">Third</span>, it enables to make <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences look more like natural language sentences. For example, consider a single relation concept that has two synonyms: the verb-form &#8220;is-located-in&#8221; and the preposition &#8220;in&#8221;, so that both represent the same ID. Then the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence &#8220;A activates B in C&#8221; is more natural to read when one can use the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; instead of the verb form (Fig. 1b vs. 1c). This support for synonymous word-forms and also conjugations (as also shown in many following examples), is a key factor in enabling the creation of <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences that are easily human-readable.</p>
<p>In summary: <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s support for synonyms and homonyms enables a curator to write easily readable information, with reduced cause for confusion; and once specified, each <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term in a statement represents one specific ID.</p>
<p><img class="i70" src="img/Fig1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Figure 1. Entering <span class="caps">VSM</span> terms.</b>
(a) A curator searches and enters a sequence of terms, each linked to an identifier that represents a particular concept or meaning (two of five searches shown). Each selected term+ID combination results in the creation of a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term user-interface element, representing that term+ID couple.
(b) The full sequence of <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms. This example is just as easily readable as a natural language sentence,
among others because the user was able to use the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; for the relation &#8220;is located in&#8221;, both of which would here represent the same identifier.
&#40;c) This sequence represents the same five IDs but illustrates a less natural choice of terms.</p>
<p>Note: in text that follows, we enclose example <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences and <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms in <strong>double quotes</strong>, and replace spaces in multi-word terms by <strong>dashes</strong>, like in this example <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence: &#8220;X is-located-in Y&#8221;. When we give examples as natural language phrases, we use <strong>&#8216;single quotes&#8217;</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors</h2>
<p><span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors correspond to the grammar or syntax of a natural language. But they are simpler, yet just about as powerful.
There are three main connector types, and you can achieve plenty with just the first one:</p>
<p><a name="trident"></a></p>
<h3>2.1. Indicating structure with the trident</h3>
<div class="shortstory">
<h4>The Short Story <span class="ssr">2/5</span></h4>
<p>Next, how can we make a computer understand the syntax of the above 5-term sentence, like we do?</p>
<p>Simple! You organize terms into &#8216;<em>triple</em>&#8216; units.
Each triple is a trio of terms that relate to each other as a Subject, Relation, and Object.
And you indicate a triple by clicking above the three terms, in said order.
By doing so you add a <em>trident</em> connector in the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box, with a distinctly drawn &#8216;leg&#8217; based on the role you gave to each term.</p>
<p>The first trident / triple is obvious :</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Next, we can easily repeat this, once we realize that
the preposition &#8220;with&#8221; is just the same as a relation, being: &#8220;using&#8221;. (See:&nbsp;<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">10</span><span class="popx popup">
 &bull; I like to say that they are different &#8216;avatars&#8217;: i.e.  manifestations, appearances, different lexical forms that represents the same thing.
 (Much more about that in The Full Story).
 <br /><br />&bull; <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms for &#8220;with&#8221; / &#8220;using&#8221; / &#8220;uses&#8221; / &#8230; would in fact all have the same ID.
 <br />So it makes no difference for a computer&#8217;s understanding which form you choose. Still, by choosing the form that we&#8217;d expect to see in e.g. English,
 we can create <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences that are much easier to read for humans.
</span></span>).
&nbsp;Realizing that, we can spot the triple: &#8220;the eating <span class="smaller">(of chicken, by John)</span>&#8220; <span class="smaller">[=subject]</span> &nbsp;
&#8220;happens using&#8221; <span class="smaller">[=relation]</span> &nbsp; &#8220;a fork&#8221; <span class="smaller">[=object]</span>.
&nbsp; So we add a second trident:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>All the terms are connected now. &#8211; You can hover over any connector to highlight it. This is useful in longer sentences, to easily see which terms it connects:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm02-9.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Try it yourself!</strong> Add those connectors in this <strong>interactive</strong> <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box :</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with', 'fork'],  [ ]); </script>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>Btw, here is a <strong>non-example</strong>: an imaginary case where a chicken holding a fork is being eaten:</p>
<script> addvsm( ['John', 'eats', 'chicken', 'with', 'fork'],  [ [0,0,1,2], [0,2,3,4] ]); </script>
<p>It&#8217;s interactive too. So unless the chicken actually has the fork, you may want to correct it :
just remove the second trident (hover it and click the top-right &#8216;x&#8217;) and re-add a correct one.</p>
<p><br />
In case you wonder why the (correct) second trident connects <strong>not to <em>John</em>, but to <em>eats</em></strong> :
If you would connect it to <em>John</em>, then it would only mean that John is using the fork for something, but not necessarily that he&#8217;s eating chicken with it:
then he could e.g. be eating chicken with his hands, and use the fork to hold a tomato! &#8211; So
it&#8217;s the <span class="undd"><em>eating</em> (by John)</span>, done <span class="undd">by-use-of</span>/with a <span class="undd">fork</span>.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">11</span><span class="popx popup">
 A note to impatient knowledge-representation experts: this intuitive description will become elegantly rigorous during the Full Story sections.
 <br /><br />Note #2: The John-holds-tomato case is shown as a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence later, on the Examples page.
</span></span></p>
<p><br />
The only bit of thinking you need to do, is to make sure that you (re)formulate your information as a series of <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms,
in such a way that you can identify triples among them, with <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors.
And that will be quite easy for more complex cases too. &#8211; But that&#8217;s for after the Full Story :</p>

<h4>The Full Story</h4>
<p>A sequence of entered <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms may initially look like a natural language statement, in which words have been disambiguated. But a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence is typically not copied verbatim from a paper (read also this note:&nbsp;<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">12</span><span class="popx popup">
 In fact, we are able to make it <i>resemble</i> natural language, because we are <i>able/allowed</i> to make <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms <i>appear</i> as conjugated verbs, nouns, prepositions, etc.
 <br />That ensures that we can keep complex information (i.e. longer sentences) easily readable for us, humans, too.
 <br />Computers do not understand conjugations etc. reliably well, so we need to clarify the structure of a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence in another way.
</span></span>).
We have often experienced that this needs to be emphasized, so we declare it as:</p>
<p>📖 <strong><span class="caps">VSM</span> Principle 1.</strong> <i>Bottom-up construction.</i>
<br />A <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence is a curator&#8217;s interpretation, or concise rephrasing, of some information&#8217;s essence<span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">6</span><span class="popx popup">
 Examples of concise paraphrasings (applied to free text): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concision">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concision</a>
</span></span>.
Curators need to reflect this understanding of knowledge that they acquired from somewhere (like literature) by entering terms in such a way that a syntax (i.e. structure of how <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms link together to create composed meaning) can be specified with <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s syntax connectors.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">13</span><span class="popx popup">
 <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors show the conceptual structure that exists in the information explicitly.
 <br />As a result, <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms&#8217; text can show a readable <strong>formulation</strong>, while <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms&#8217; IDs and the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors show the <strong>conceptualization</strong> structure that exists in the information, intuitively and clearly.
</span></span>These <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors are added through a user interface and are available in <span class="undl">three main types</span>: the <i>trident</i> (incl. three <i>bident</i> subtypes), the <i>list-connector</i> (of any length), and the <i>co-reference</i>.</p>
<p>In what follows, we explain how <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors are used to syntactically specify the meaning of <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences. We start with simple statements, and next progress toward statements with complex internal structure that convey rich contextual information.</p>
<p>We start with the <strong>trident</strong>. A curator can add structure to a statement by identifying triples, or subunits consisting of three <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms. At first glance these triples look similar to <span class="caps">RDF</span>-triples<span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">7</span><span class="popx popup">
 &bull; <span class="caps">RDF</span> in general: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">Wiki:RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/"><span class="caps">W3C</span></a>,
 <a href="http://www.linkeddatatools.com/introducing-rdf-part-2">tutorial</a>.
 <br />&bull; E.g. triples represented in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#simple-triples"><span class="caps">RDF</span> Turtle</a>.
</span></span>,
yet we elaborate on that further below. The UI enables a user to specify triples by linking terms with a trident connector. A trident is added via three consecutive clicks, one above each term according to the role it has in the triple, in the order of: subject, relation, and direct object<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">14</span><span class="popx popup">
 An <i>indirect</i> object must be captured via an extra relation; e.g. &#8216;Ann gives Eve X&#8217; as &#8216;Ann gives X <span class="undl">to</span> Eve&#8217;.
</span></span>.
The corresponding, attaching parts of the trident, which we call its <strong>legs</strong>, are: a simple line, a line decorated with an up-pointing filled triangle, and a down-pointing arrow, respectively. Figure 2a shows a simple example one-triple statement that is specified with a trident, and that expresses that a &#8220;John&#8221; &#8220;eats&#8221; a &#8220;chicken&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="i60" src="img/Fig2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Figure 2. Specifying triples with tridents.</b>
(a-b) The user adds trident <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors that specify triples (subject-relation-object triplets) of <i>individual terms</i> (as indicated by leg positions and leg foot-widths); as subunits defining the intended syntax. The resulting composite semantics is explained in the main text. (b-d) Meaning changes when the rightmost connector&#8217;s subject-leg is attached to a different term.</p>
<p><a name="principle-2"></a></p>
<p>Next we will show by example how to use multiple tridents, after which we can explain <span class="caps">VSM</span> Principles 2 and 3. Figure 2b shows the addition of more terms or context via a second trident, again attaching to <i>individual <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms</i> (n.b.: <span class="undl">not</span> to any previous subunit as a whole). This specifies a second triple subunit that expresses: this &#8220;eating&#8221; happens &#8220;with&#8221; (or &#8220;using&#8221;), a &#8220;fork&#8221;. We represented this second triple&#8217;s relation by a preposition-type synonym, for natural-language-like readability.  In contrast, Fig. 2c shows an alternative version in which a chicken is using a fork instead. This illustrates that attaching a connector leg to a different term fundamentally changes the meaning. Similarly, Fig. 2d states that John uses a fork, although it does not say he eats chicken with it (he could be eating chicken with his hand, while using the fork for another purpose). Only by connecting the second trident to the &#8220;eating&#8221; term, one captures the correct meaning: &#8216;the eating (by John, of chicken), is by use of a fork&#8217;.</p>
<p>This example introduces an elementary way of thinking, as a basis that can be scaled up to knowledge of any complexity. This is further elaborated in:</p>
<p>📖 <strong><span class="caps">VSM</span> Principle 2.</strong> <i>Referable entities.</i>
<br />A connector leg always attaches to one particular term, and never to an entire other triple/subunit. This is even true when a leg attaches to a term that is used as a relation in another triple; and this makes <span class="caps">VSM</span> different from the typical approach in <span class="caps">RDF</span>.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">15</span><span class="popx popup">
 In <span class="caps">RDF</span> one typically makes a <i>reification</i> construct in order to point to a relation; i.e. one creates an additional <i>entity</i> (a <i>blank node</i>) that represents that <i>relation</i> (or in fact, its entire triple), that one can then point to. Because <span class="caps">RDF</span> treats <i>relations</i> as fundamentally different things than <i>entities</i>.
 <br />(For an overview of four approaches or proposals for referring to relations in <span class="caps">RDF</span>, see ref: &#8220;Hernández D, et al. Reifying <span class="caps">RDF</span>: What works well with Wikidata?, <span class="caps">ISWC</span>, 2015&#8243;).
 <br />In fact Principle 2, pertaining to relations, is similar to the <i>n-ary relations</i> approach in <span class="caps">RDF</span>, if that would be applied consistently to all relations (except for a few <i>primitive</i> relations like has-subject/object/etc., which is what the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors actually represent).
</span></span>This difference is intentional, and lies at the basis of making the syntax-definition process flexible, scalable, and intuitive, following the thinking of the curator. It is rooted in <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s specific approach to <i>treat all <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms equally</i>: both so-called entities and relations are first-class citizens. In <span class="caps">VSM</span>, <i>any term is only viewed as a relation instead of an entity, within a particular subunit, under a particular trident</i> that connects to it with its relation-leg. Because of that, any term that happens to function as a relation under one trident can function as a subject or object (i.e. an entity) when viewed under another connecting trident.</p>
<p>For instance, in Fig. 1b the verb term &#8220;activates&#8221; can (and should) equally be thought of as a noun: &#8216;activation&#8217;. In Fig. 2b the verb term &#8220;eats&#8221; is in meaning identical to its noun-form &#8216;the eating&#8217;. If both lexical alternatives are available as terms in a dictionary for <span class="caps">VSM</span>, they should carry the same ID.</p>
<p>In summary: <i>every <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term should primarily be thought of as an entity</i> – i.e. a referable thing.</p>
<p><span class="undl">Note</span>: the <span class="caps">VSM</span> Principles are not verbatim definitions. They may be rephrased using various wordings, for instance depending on the intended readers&#8217; background or on a chosen format of explaining <span class="caps">VSM</span>. This can offer additional perspectives that put these principles into proper context, and that together better convey the core idea.
<br />See also this note:&nbsp;<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">16</span><span class="popx popup">
 Principle 2 is crucial, so we repeat it once more in other words:
 <br />
  Only when some trident attaches to a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term with its relation-leg, only then is the term made to be seen as a relation. And then only so, under that one trident, i.e. locally in that one triple subunit.
 <br /><br />
  What <span class="caps">RDF</span> (or formal logic) typically view as a relation (or <i>predicate</i>), <span class="caps">VSM</span> views only <strong>locally as a relation</strong> (under a particular connector, in one subunit) and views it elsewhere as an entity / as &#8216;reified&#8217; / as a noun.
 <br />
  <span class="smaller">(The <span class="caps">RDF</span> phrase &#8216;re-ified&#8217;, based on Latin, means &#8216;thing-ified&#8217; or &#8216;made into an object&#8217;).</span>
 <br /><br />
  This was an essential, necessary step for designing <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s expressivity and simplicity in what will follow:
 <br />
  think of <strong>all</strong> <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms as nouns / &#8216;thingified&#8217; concepts / something that one can always refer to or mentally point to again. Like this, one can immediately refer to any <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term, always in the same way.
</span></span>(&lt;&ndash; really, read it).</p>
<p><a name="short-story-3"></a></p>
<h3>2.2. Scaling up to more complex information</h3>
<div class="shortstory">
<h4>The Short Story :&nbsp; Just keep adding tridents <span class="ssr">3/5</span></h4>
<h5 class="sect">1)&nbsp; Mechanism</h5>
<p>Here is a biological example. It says: &#8216;some molecule A activates a molecule B in a location C&#8217; :</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm03-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hereby &#8220;in&#8221; represents the same ID as &#8220;is-located-in&#8221;, but it&#8217;s easier to read like that in a sentence.
<br />The two tridents express, resp.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;A&nbsp; activates&nbsp; B&#8221;, and</li>
	<li>&#8220;the-activation-of-B-by-A&nbsp; is-located-in&nbsp; C&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you see what happened here? :
The first trident turned &#8220;activates&#8221; into a more specific term &#8220;<em>the</em> activation of B by A&#8221; &nbsp;(i.e. it is &#8216;<em>placed in the context of A and B</em> &#8216;).&nbsp;
And that enabled the second trident to connect to that particular&#8217;ized concept, and specify it further: &#8220;<em>that-A-B-activation</em> &nbsp;is-located-in &nbsp;C&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, this &#8216;context sharing&#8217; happens for all connected terms. For example the first term now represents &#8216;<em>the A</em> that activates B, in C&#8217;,
and the last term &#8216;<em>the C</em> in which&#8230;&#8217;, etc.
<br />So <strong>every time you add a connector,&nbsp; each of the connected terms&nbsp; receives extra context&nbsp; from all others</strong>.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">17</span><span class="popx popup">
 Some more ways to say this:&nbsp;
 &#8216;each term <em>is placed in the context of</em> / accumulates extra context-meaning from all others&#8217;, or:&nbsp;
 &#8216;all connected <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms <em>enrich</em> each other&#8217;s meaning&#8217;.
 <br />This context meaning is shared with indirectly connected <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms too.
 <br /><br />In the example, even the term &#8220;in&#8221; now specifically represents &#8216;the being located in C of the A-B-activation&#8217;.
 This is really useful. Because then you can say more about <em>that</em> concept again.
 For example: &#8216;that being-located in&#8230;&#8217; is only &#8220;probable&#8221;. Then we can form the sentence: &#8220;A activates B probably in C&#8221;.
 <span class="smaller">(To add adverbs, see next Short Story).</span>
</span></span>And <strong>that turns&nbsp;each <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term into a specific thing that you can refer to again</strong>, with a new connector, to add more and more context.</p>
<h5 class="sect">2)&nbsp; Teaser</h5>
<p>Let&#8217;s extend the above sentence. Let&#8217;s add an extra context detail, saying that our &#8220;A&#8221; is also &#8216;bound to a molecule D&#8217;.
In a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box we can enter two more terms at the end, drag them in place for human readability, and connect them to &#8220;A&#8221;:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm03-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm03-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm03-4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm03-5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>That last step shows that new connectors get <em>auto-sorted</em> for visual comfort, after you add them on top.</p>
<p>Now, using the same principle, we can keep adding <em>nested</em> context with <span class="caps">VSM</span>, just like we can in natural language.</p>
<h5 class="sect">3)&nbsp; Showcase</h5>

<h4>The Full Story</h4>
<p>In order to scale this method up to statements with many more terms, one must keep in mind a third key principle. It provides a way of thinking that will be instrumental for constructing longer and valid <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences, and for unambiguously interpreting their meaning.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">20</span><span class="popx popup">
 In particular, Principle 3 will support the creation of clear <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences in which an entity is described in detail in multiple situations (see section 2.5).
</span></span></p>
<p>📖 <strong><span class="caps">VSM</span> Principle 3.</strong> <i>Embedded context.</i>
<br />When a trident (or any <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connector except coreference, see later) is added, each of its connected terms receives extra &#8216;<i>context meaning</i>&#8216; from the other connected terms. In other words: a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term does not just represent a particular entity (or thing, or instance); instead it represents a particular entity, in a particular situation (or state, or <i>local context</i>) that is specified by all the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms connected to it, directly but also indirectly. For example, in Fig. 2a the first trident makes the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term &#8220;eats&#8221; (which without connections would just represent a particular but not further specified &#8216;eating&#8217;) now represent &#8216;the eating, of a chicken, by John&#8217;; i.e. some contextual details are now <i>embedded</i> into this individual <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term&#8217;s meaning. This applies to all three <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms, so &#8220;chicken&#8221; becomes &#8216;the chicken eaten by John&#8217;, and also &#8220;John&#8221; becomes a more specific concept.</p>
<p>Next, when one connects a second trident to any of these three terms, one in fact refers to that term&#8217;s full, <i>context-enriched meaning</i>, as created by its connection under the first trident. So with the second trident in Fig. 2b, one expresses: &#8220;the-eating-of-chicken-by-John  happens-with  fork&#8221;. By induction, all five terms now carry an enriched meaning, acquired or composed from the other four. Next, each of these terms is individually referable again, in the same way. Continuing like this, <i>one can keep adding further connections and thus further context details to every single <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term</i>, recursively.</p>
<p>For instance, to express &#8216;John eats a chicken, occasionally using a fork&#8217;, one would add two terms and then connect a new trident to &#8220;using&#8221;, to create a new triple that states: &#8220;using (of fork, by eating of chicken by John)  has-frequency  occasionally&#8221;. (See Bidents, section 2.3, for how to intuitively add adverbs). All added detail to the meaning, delivered by connections, form what we call a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term&#8217;s <i>local context</i>. So each <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term is coupled with its own, local, or embedded context in the <span class="caps">VSM</span> sense.</p>
<p>Additional perspective is given in notes<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">21</span><span class="popx popup">
 <b>The notion of <i>local context</i> in <span class="caps">VSM</span></b> differs from <i>context</i> in e.g. Conceptual Graphs (CG) or <span class="caps">RDF</span> Named Graphs, which take a <i>formal logic</i> based starting-point for representing meaning.
 <br />&bull; Their <i>context</i> can be seen as a <i>separate</i> object that is <i>shared</i> among a group of concepts, in order to manage the scope of logical quantifiers. (<span class="undd">CG</span>: Sowa JF, &#8220;Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine&#8221;, 1984; <span class="undd"><span class="caps">RDF</span></span>: Caroll JJ, &#8220;Named Graphs&#8221;, 2005).
 <br />&bull; In contrast, <span class="caps">VSM</span> starts from an association-based viewpoint, which is instrumental for prioritizing different objectives.
 (A <i>formal</i> definition is a future prospect).
</span></span>and<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">22</span><span class="popx popup">
 While Principle 2 defines the nature or meaning of individual <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms, Principle 3 defines how the meaning of each of them changes by attaching connectors to them.
 <br />Note that at this point, Principle 3 may be intuitive or even seem trivial for simple cases like Fig. 2.
 But it provides a crucial way of thinking for handling cases that need the coreference connector (sections 2.5 and 2.6).
</span></span>,
on the notion of context in <span class="caps">VSM</span>.</p>
<p>It is essential to realize that a trident in itself carries no meaning. This should be evident from the fact that <i>a connector never connects to another connector, but only connects to</i> <span class="undl"><i>individual terms</i></span>. In fact, <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors only act as <i>operators</i> on individual <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms&#8217; meanings. They specify or narrow down the meaning of a term. They make some of its specifics (which make the term a particular instance of something) explicit. For example, in Fig. 2a the particular &#8220;eating&#8221; is not specified to be done in any specific way; that context is not given, so as far as we know it could be done with hands, a stick, fork and knife etc. But in Fig. 2b the meaning is narrowed down: by specifying the triple &#8220;eats with fork&#8221;, it is made explicit what is used for John&#8217;s action of eating. It narrows down &#8220;eats&#8221;&#8216;s meaning by anchoring down at least one more aspect of how it happens. Meanwhile, other unknowns remain: where John eats, if he eats alone or together with someone, how quickly he eats, etc.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">23</span><span class="popx popup">

<p>Figure 3 shows longer <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences created in this way, representing information curated from scientific publications. For example, in Fig. 3a the second trident from the left declares a triple expressing &#8220;the-being-twisted-of-leaf-lamina&nbsp; pertains-to&nbsp;  Oryza-that-underexpresses-<span class="caps">YAB3</span>-by-<span class="caps">RNA</span>-interference&#8221;.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">24</span><span class="popx popup">
 For non-biologists: this means that plant-leaves are deformed in a particular way in a rice plant, which had the activity of one of its genes turned down, using some technique for achieving that.
</span></span>Here, the term &#8220;in&#8221; will have been linked by the curator to the concept &#8220;pertaining-to&#8221; rather than &#8220;is-located-in&#8221;. Each term represents an ID from a controlled vocabulary, e.g. &#8220;leaf-lamina&#8221; is provided by PO (Plant Ontology), and &#8220;twisted&#8221; by <span class="caps">PATO</span> (Phenotype And Trait Ontology).<span class="note dry popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">11</span><span class="popx popup">

<p>We want to accentuate that any additional context, like the biological details captured here, helps to increase the quality and value of the information. Added detail could for instance resolve two seemingly contradictory &#8216;bare triple&#8217; statements through reconciliatory contextual details.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">25</span><span class="popx popup">
 For example both &#8216;bare triple&#8217; statements &#8220;cat is alive&#8221; and &#8220;cat is dead&#8221; can be true. But they would be true in their own specific context.
 <br />We could make this context explicit by expanding the statements to e.g. &#8220;cat is alive in 2020&#8243; and &#8220;cat is dead in 2100&#8243;.
</span></span>Added detail is also vital when the collected information needs to be filtered down; for instance based on various quality measures determined by various use cases&#8217; requirements.</p>

Some of their terms come from ontologies and controlled vocabularies (CVs), others are yet to be added to official CVs, especially relation terms.</p>
<p>We point out that all connections to a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term together define its contextualized meaning; i.e. all connections are <i>applied simultaneously</i>: they add meaning in a way that order does not matter.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">26</span><span class="popx popup">
 For cases where the semantics requires a deviation from this, see section 2.6.
</span></span>Therefore, the vertical stacking order in which connectors are added or displayed is irrelevant for the connection structure (topology) and its resulting semantics. Still, some stacking order may look more intuitive than others, for example based on which subunit or term one thinks of as central in the statement (see <i>Head</i> later). Various visual sort algorithms may be developed for this UI aspect. We already implemented one that automatically rearranges the stacking of connectors as shown in Fig. 3, no matter in what order they were added.</p>
<p>Note that although a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence can be mapped to <span class="caps">RDF</span>, either directly when two non-relation legs connect to a term, or via <span class="caps">RDF</span>-reification when a non-relation leg attaches to a term also used as a relation, such <span class="caps">RDF</span> graph renditions quickly become unintelligible to a curator (see later in <a href="discussion#fig-vsm-rdf">Fig. 10</a> on the Discussion page for a full example).
<br /><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>A consequence of Principle 3&#8217;s definition of <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s semantics is that tridents (together with bidents and list-connectors, see later) must <b>never create loops</b>. A loop exists when one can follow a path of connections from one term that leads back to that term. (A loop is called a <i>cycle</i> in graph theory).</p>
<p>To illustrate: consider for instance a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence that expresses &#8220;John eating apple calls Eve buying apple&#8221;, and let us leave aside for a moment whether it is the same apple or not. The trident that connects &#8220;Eve buying apple&#8221; must always connect to a second &#8220;apple&#8221; <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term (Fig. 4b). It must not &#8216;reuse&#8217; the first &#8220;apple&#8221; that would already be connected in &#8220;John eating apple&#8221; (Fig. 4a). Because if it did, it would make it impossible to interpret the meaning (following <span class="caps">VSM</span> Principle 3): the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence would be read as: &#8216;John, eating an apple, &rarr; that is being bought by Eve, who is called by John, eating an apple, &rarr; &hellip;&#8217;. It would have to be read like that, because <i>every trident-connection a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term has, must be followed (i.e. applied) when interpreting its meaning.</i> Furthermore, if &#8216;apple&#8217; would have additional <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms attached (e.g. specifying its color), then this loop would create several interpretation possibilities, i.e.: from which of the two &#8216;directions of encounter&#8217; in the loop would the color apply: for the situation where John eats it, or the reverse, the situation where Eve buys it (i.e. &#8216;John calls Eve, buying apple, &hellip;&#8217;)? This means that a connection loop creates context ambiguity. So in conclusion: with tridents (and bidents and list-connectors; later), one must only create hierarchical structures.</p>
<p>It may already be clear intuitively that when two distinct &#8216;apple&#8217; entities (physical objects) are at play, then two &#8220;apple&#8221; <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms (separate, referable concepts) are needed.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">27</span><span class="popx popup">
 I.e. two instances of &#8220;apple&#8221; are needed. Each one would have its own instance-ID, plus a class-ID for the general concept it is an instance of.
 <br />This, however, is a more technical aspect of <span class="caps">VSM</span> that is covered by the <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-box">vsm-box</a> implementation (and also a bit on the <a href="vsmgraph"><span class="caps">VSM</span>-Graphs</a> page, later).
</span></span>However, also if a sentence would mention one and the same apple twice, then the above shows that two <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms must be used: one for each context. For that, a coreference connector will be needed (see later, section 2.5).</p>

<h3>2.3. A variation on the trident: bidents</h3>
<div class="shortstory">
<h5>The Short Story <span class="ssr">4/5</span></h5>
<p>A phrase like &#8216;white mouse&#8217; is not a triplet of terms. So how do we write this with <span class="caps">VSM</span>?</p>
<p>Simple. Just read the phrase silently as: it&#8217;s a &#8220;mouse [being] white&#8221;.
Meanwhile you add a trident, from &#8220;mouse&#8221; as a subject, to &#8220;white&#8221; as an object,
but you skip the <em>implicit relation</em>&#8216;s leg: just click twice over &#8220;white&#8221;.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">28</span><span class="popx popup">
 You could also read it as<br />&#8220;mouse [specified-to-be] white&#8221;, or as<br />&#8220;mouse [has-color] white&#8221;.
 <br />And the computer would understand it like that too, because it should already know that &#8220;white&#8221; is a color,
 and so it could infer the more specific &#8220;[has&#8209;color]&#8221; if needed.
</span></span>The connector now has only two legs, so we call it a <em>bident</em> :</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm05-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm05-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm05-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Such &#8216;attribute&#8217; connections keep <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences easy to read and write. And that is a main goal in <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s design.
Still, the Full Story discusses some limitations to ensure computer-understanding.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This 1-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/zL2eYTAqTZU?t=16s"><span class="caps">VSM</span>-box demo Youtube video</a> illustrates what we&#8217;ve learned so far.</p>
<p>From here on we&#8217;ll explain the rest of <span class="caps">VSM</span> as Full Stories, mainly. &nbsp;A preview:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>any</strong> of a trident&#8217;s legs can be skipped, creating bidents for e.g. &#8220;X explodes&#8221; or &#8220;activation [of] B&#8221;;</li>
	<li>there is a <strong>list connector</strong>, to capture e.g. &#8220;A, B, and C&#8221;, or &#8220;either A, B, or C&#8221;;</li>
	<li>there is a <strong>coreference connector</strong>, the third and final connector you&#8217;d need for complex cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="ssr ssri">(you could skip past all that, and jump to <a href="vsm#short-story-5">Short Story 5 &rarr;</a>)</span>
<br /></p>
</div>
<h5>The Full Story</h5>
<p>Some information is unnatural to express with triples. For instance, some verbs have no object, as in &#8220;plant flowers&#8221;. Although this can be captured with a triple (the typical approach in <span class="caps">RDF</span>) like &#8220;plant  belongs-to  class-of-flowering-things&#8221;, the task of stretching and reformulating such information to fit a triple structure is a burden that is best not imposed on the curator. <span class="caps">VSM</span> is focused on usability for the curator, and therefore the <span class="caps">VSM</span> UI supports tridents where one leg can be left away: <b>bidents</b>. The remaining two legs still appoint the same semantics, i.e. they assign the same role to the two terms in their subunit, as they would for a full trident.</p>
<p>In the example above, no object needs to be defined and the object leg is omitted (Fig. 5a). A user can create this <b>first type</b> of bident just like a trident, but with the third mouse click outside the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box component, or by pressing Escape instead of the third mouse click.</p>
<p>Bidents also make <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s knowledge representation <i>structurally consistent</i>. For instance, compare the statements &#8220;X stimulates: A activates B&#8221;, and &#8220;X stimulates activation-of B&#8221;, where the latter uses a <b>second type</b> of bident: one that omits the subject leg (Fig. 5b-c). Apart from using the appropriate synonym for the &#8220;activation&#8221; relation (with same ID), the principal difference is that the activator is unspecified in the latter case. Appropriately, the structure of both statements is similar, thanks to the bident. This consistency would not be present when using a second triple &#8220;activation having-object B&#8221; with an artificial relation inserted.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">29</span><span class="popx popup">
 Note for experts:
 <br />
  One could also enter &#8220;activation&nbsp; <strong>of</strong> &nbsp;B&#8221;, by using an explicit <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term &#8220;<strong>of</strong>&#8220;, which would have the meta-meaning &#8216;has&nbsp;object&#8217;.
 <br /><br />
  Note #2: please do not misunderstand and think that &#8216;VSM knows&#8217; if two sentences (two graph structures) would represent a same, rephrased meaning.
 <span class="caps">VSM</span> does not &#8216;know&#8217;. <span class="caps">VSM</span> is just a <em>representation form</em>,
 to be used by people and algorithms. &#8211; Just
 like &#8216;English does not know&#8217; what you mean. Your brain does, and it uses English to represent information at some level.
</span></span>This bident is also useful for capturing passive constructs where a subject is irrelevant, as could be the case in &#8220;X accelerates destruction-of B&#8221; or &#8220;to-write(=writing-of)  text is rewarding&#8221;. One starts this bident with two clicks above the relation.</p>
<p><a name="bident-relationless"></a></p>
<p>A <b>third type</b> of bident omits the relation leg. Again, this helps usability for the curator, in this case by allowing statements to better reflect a basic structure also used in natural language: the attribute. Attributes include adjectives, adverbs, and numbers. For example, a statement about a &#8216;white mouse&#8217; would require a &#8220;mouse having-color white&#8221; when using only the triple structure. However, if the term &#8220;white&#8221; is already classified as a &#8220;color&#8221; in its vocabulary or ontology, then making curators explicitly insert the relation &#8220;having-color&#8221; would be a waste of effort, since it can be inferred automatically. Then, a bident structure can be used, as in Fig. 5d-e. The relation is omitted via two clicks above the object term. This bident in fact indicates an <b>implicit relation</b>, most generally seen as: &#8216;is specified by&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, in order to keep the semantics with relation-omitting bidents clear, consider this:
<br />&bull; In general, a category of terms that can be used as attributes, may need to be associated with its own default, more specific implicit-relation; e.g.: numbers (&#8220;&hellip; [has-count] 5&#8243;), measures (&#8220;&hellip; [has-size] big&#8221;), or posttranslational modifications (&#8220;&hellip; [has-state] phosphorylated&#8221;); see also Fig. 5f-g.
<br />&bull; In other cases, this could be associated with the attribute&#8217;s linked concept as well. For example: &#8220;&lt;tree&#8209;x&gt; leaf&#8221; would mean &#8220;leaf [from-plant-of-species] &lt;tree&#8209;x&gt;&#8221;, e.g. &#8220;oak leaf&#8221;. Or &#8220;&lt;gene&#8209;x&gt; expression&#8221; would mean &#8220;expression [of] &lt;gene&#8209;x&gt;&#8221;, e.g. &#8220;Cas9 expression&#8221;.
<br />&bull; However, for attribute constructions as in natural language where the implicit relation is not yet automatically inferable to something more specific, one must use either an explicit triple or a single term. For example, &#8216;actin filament&#8217; would then need to be represented as &#8220;filament composed-of actin&#8221; or as &#8220;actin-filament&#8221;.</p>
<p>The above demonstrates that knowledge representation in <span class="caps">VSM</span> more closely follows the thinking of the curator, or the conceptualization structure in the human mind. This is one key aspect that makes <span class="caps">VSM</span> more intuitive.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Figure 5. Bidents.</b>
The user can add a trident and omit any one of its three legs, i.e. create a bident, for ease of use and structural consistency as explained in the main text.
(a) The <i>object-omitting bident</i> (or <i>oobi</i>) accommodates a verb without an object.
(b-c) The <i>subject-omitting bident</i> (or <i>sobi</i>) specifies a unit with an unknown or unstated subject, here &#8220;activation(-of) B&#8221;. The bident enables representing this information in a form structurally similar to the case where a subject &#8220;A&#8221; would be known and can be attached to a full trident&#8217;s subject-leg. The availability of bidents makes this kind of structural consistency straightforward to achieve (which is not necessarily the case in <span class="caps">RDF</span>, see later in Fig. 10).
(d-e) The <i>relation-omitting bident</i> (or <i>robi</i>) implies an implicit relation &#8216;is specified by&#8217;. It frees the curator from the obligation to explicitly define a more specific relation that could be computationally inferred.
(f-g) Various attributes can be connected via a robi bident. Here, the more specific implicit-relations would be inferable to be: &#8220;has-precision&#8221;, &#8220;has-count&#8221;, and &#8220;has-concentration&#8221;.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">30</span><span class="popx popup">
 This figure also shows that <b>numbers can be represented with <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms</b>. This makes sense because one &#8220;5&#8243; can be conceptually different from another &#8220;5&#8243;; because just like other <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms, a numeric concept can be embedded in a particular context. For example, one could be an &#8220;approximately&nbsp; 5&#8243;, another a &#8220;5 &nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp; 2&#8243;, and another could be contextually specified or modified to mean &#8220;at-least&nbsp; 5&#8243;.
 <br />
  For this, the autocomplete system needs to support the entry of numeric concepts. But there are infinitely many of them possible, so they cannot be stored in any prepared vocabulary. So the autocomplete will need to automatically generate an ID + term-label for any of them as needed, based on some pattern and on what the user is typing.
 <br />(This was not yet implemented in the prototype used on this web page, but is now supported via the &#8216;<a href="https://github.com/vsm">vsm</a>&#8216; GitHub-project&#8217;s modules:

  Other numeric concepts like dates or timestamps could similarly be provided to the user. For this, additional dictionary software-modules that generate such concepts should be easy to implement.

<h3>2.4. Group types that combine items: the list&#8209;connector</h3>
<p>Consider a statement like &#8216;A, B, and C react to D&#8217;. In order to build this with triples only, as in <span class="caps">RDF</span>, one would first make an &#8220;A and B&#8221;, then connect their &#8220;and&#8221; to &#8220;and C&#8221;, and then connect this second &#8220;and&#8221; to &#8220;react-to D&#8221;. However, it may be unknown in which order reactants combine. This construct with triples is artificial, as it may suggest that A and B combine first and then together combine with C. In addition, the longer the list that needs to be made, the more burdensome all the artificial triples would become to the curator.</p>
<p>With <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s <strong>list-connector</strong>, one can express that any number of <strong>list-item</strong> terms all come together as one group, in a way specified by the meaning of a <strong>list-relation</strong> term. For example, Fig. 6a states that reactants all together react to D, as a group with unspecified order. The fact that group order is unspecified, would be embedded in the meaning/ID of the chosen list-relation &#8220;and&#8221; (or: &#8220;and-(as-unordered-set)&#8221;). The curator is free to choose other list-relations as well: for instance a term &#8220;and-(as-ordered-list)&#8221;; or &#8220;sum&#8209;of&#8221;; or &#8220;either&#8209;or&#8221;, which is used in Fig. 6b to state that &#8216;either A, B, or C bind to D&#8217;. This term &#8220;either&#8209;or&#8221; is also an example of a single conceptual component that is formulated with two separated parts in natural language, and that must be captured with a single term in <span class="caps">VSM</span>.</p>
<p>The position of a list-relation among its list-items has no semantic importance, although some placing can make a sentence easier to read; like putting &#8220;and&#8221; second-to-last in Fig. 6a. Just like with tridents, only the resulting connection- or graph-structure is important. There is only one exception to this rule: the order in which list-items are placed is important when the list-relation attaches meaning to the ordering has meaning, as with a &#8220;and-(as-ordered-list)&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a semantic operator, a list-connector turns its list-relation <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term into the specific concept/idea of a group of items combined in the way defined by this list-relation. Similar to how tridents operate, the list-connectors in Fig. 6a-b contextualize their list-relation term into a specific &#8220;the-A-B-C-group&#8221;, and (for lack of a less artificial way of phrasing) &#8220;the-eitherOr-union-of-A-B-C&#8221;, respectively. Then once again, another connector can link to this term as it represents the specific, whole group.</p>
<p><img class="i55" src="img/Fig6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Figure 6. List-connectors.</b>
In (a), the list-connector assigns &#8220;and&#8221; as a list-relation that groups a number of list-elements. The connected list-relation &#8220;and&#8221; represents the combination of the list-elements &#8216;as a whole&#8217;, and as such can represent the left side of a reaction. Other terms can be used as a list-relation. In (b), the list-connector makes the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term &#8220;either-or&#8221; represent the phrase &#8216;either A, B, or C&#8217;.</p>
<p>In Fig. 6 we show a <acronym title="user interface"><span class="caps">UI</span></acronym> that distinguishes list-connectors by drawing them with a double &#8216;backbone&#8217;, a leg ending in a filled square that connects the list-relation, and undecorated legs that connect list-items. The UI should support switching between trident and list-connector creation modes, for instance by holding the Shift button down while first clicking above the list-relation, and next above all list-items. If order is important for the list-relation, then it is not the order of clicking above terms, but the order of terms as they appear in the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence that counts.</p>
<p><a name="coreference"></a></p>
<h3>2.5. Referring and further specifying: the co&#8209;reference</h3>
<p>The <strong>coreference</strong> connector provides the extra functionality needed for both common and advanced use cases. Its first, basic function is to let users build semantically correct, easily readable sentences with a term that refers back to another term; for instance an &#8220;it&#8221; as in Fig. 7. We call this &#8220;it&#8221; the <strong>child</strong> term. The child term is a placeholder that receives meaning from its <strong>parent</strong> term: the term it refers to. A child term can have any label (&#8220;that&#8221;, &#8220;them&#8221;, etc.), and represents the same &#8216;thing&#8217; as its parent. So for example in Fig. 7a, &#8220;it&#8221; refers to the same &#8220;apple&#8221; as its parent term; so this contrasts with the earlier Fig. 4b, where two distinct &#8220;apple&#8220;s were mentioned. &nbsp;&ndash; Note that the no-loops rule (that followed from Principle 3) does not apply to coreferences, as will become clear later. &nbsp;&ndash; In Fig. 7, the UI draws the coreference in dashed lines, with an undecorated leg connecting to the child, and an open triangle arrow connecting to the parent; and the child term is surrounded with dashes. Users add a coreference by first Ctrl+clicking above the child term, and next above the parent term.</p>
<p>The second function of the coreference is that it enables us to think about <strong>two distinct concepts</strong>. Although the parent and child term refer to one and the same &#8216;thing&#8217; in the real world, they refer to that thing as it occurs in two different situations, or perspectives, or contexts.</p>
<p>Consider for example &#8220;Bob activates device in evening causes it beeps in morning&#8221; (Fig. 7c). The meaning embedded into the parent concept &#8220;device&#8221; is that it is activated by someone, but should not be that it is beeping yet. Therefore (and because of no-loops), we should not connect &#8220;device&#8221; directly to &#8220;beeps&#8221; with a trident. Instead, we create a child concept &#8220;it&#8221;, which <strong>inherits the context</strong> of &#8216;having been activated in the evening&#8217; from its parent, and in addition <strong>receives the extra context</strong> of &#8220;beeping in morning&#8221; from its own connection environment. These two concepts can then be separately enriched with more context, or referred to later on, e.g. &#8220;Jane charges it (#1)&#8221; and &#8220;Bob silences it (#2)&#8221;. &ndash; A biological example could involve a molecule being tagged in one context, e.g. in some cell cycle phase or location, which causes it to form a bond in a next/further context &ndash; or see Fig. 7b.</p>
<p><img class="i55" src="img/Fig7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Figure 7. The co-reference connector.</b>
(a,b,c) The coreference has two functions. First, it allows to build <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences in which a same concept is referred two twice (here: same apple/protein/device), that has no loops (created by tridents/bidents/lists), and that is natural to read (via a placeholder with label like &#8220;it&#8221;). Second, it enables one to work with two distinct concepts, each at a different stage of specification: in &#40;c) the first &#8220;device&#8221; is not yet beeping, while the second occurrence of the device, represented by the child-term &#8220;it&#8221;, is beeping. A curator could still add further specifics about the device, in both of its contexts. Similarly in (a), the parent-term &#8220;apple&#8221; is not yet described as being eaten by Eve, and in (b), the first occurrence of &#8220;protein B&#8221; is not specified to be degrading.</p>
<p>Now we can clarify why the no-loops rule, which followed from Principle 3, only applies to tridents, bidents, and lists-connectors, but not to coreferences. Unlike the other connectors, a coreference does not enrich the meaning of the parent term, and so it should not be followed when interpreting the parent&#8217;s meaning. As a semantic operator, the coreference works only on the child concept; but also here it does not enrich an existing concept. In fact, it creates a new copy of the parent&#8217;s context-embedded meaning and places that at the position of the child, where it can be further contextualized.</p>
<p>The two distinct concepts (parent and child) are not particularly about past versus present, but about how much context is present in each part of the discourse. Hereby it is helpful to think of the coreference as a unidirectional &#8216;wind arrow&#8217; that points to where context is &#8216;flowing from&#8217;, as in &#8216;inherited from&#8217;. This notion is crucial to understand the following issue: the case where (trident/bident/list-)connector attachments are non-interchangeable, as explained in the next section.</p>
<p><a name="non-interchangeable-connections"></a></p>
<h3>2.6. Non-interchangeable connections &nbsp; <span class="smaller"><em>(advanced, but nice topic)</em></span></h3>
<p>When connecting multiple tridents or bidents to a term, we use one assumption: that the order of connecting them does not matter. This is usually true. In natural language one can test this by observing that the meaning of some statement does not change when switching attribute positions; e.g. &#8216;big white mouse&#8217; has the same meaning as &#8216;white big mouse&#8217;. Likewise in <span class="caps">VSM</span>, each new connection simply adds context in an interchangeable, additive way: in Fig. 8a, &#8220;mouse&#8221; is specified to be both &#8220;big&#8221; <em>and</em> &#8220;white&#8221; at the same time.</p>
<p>However, in some cases order does matter, as e.g. in the statement &#8220;half-of black dogs&#8221;. By connecting &#8220;half-of&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; to &#8220;dogs&#8221;, one can construct three different meanings (see the sets in Fig. 8b1-3):</p>
<ol>
	<li>&#8216;some half of the group of dogs, that consists of only black ones&#8217;: here &#8220;dogs&#8221; is specified to &#8220;half-of&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; at the same time (while still being half-of in total);</li>
	<li>&#8216;some half of: black ones of the dogs&#8217;;</li>
	<li>&#8216;black ones of: some half of the dogs&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<p>In <strong>case 1</strong>, the attributes are &#8216;applied&#8217; simultaneously, while in cases 2 and 3 they are applied in one of the two possible orders.</p>
<p>What happens when order matters, conceptually, is that we first compose an idea, and then we isolate it and refer to it, without letting the further added context mix in with it. This is in fact exactly how also the coreference connector works: in e.g. <strong>case 2</strong> in Fig. 8b2 one can first construct a parent concept (&#8220;black dogs&#8221;), and then create a placeholder child concept (e.g. labeled &#8220;them&#8221;<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">31</span><span class="popx popup">
 &#8220;them&#8221; is a somewhat arbitrary chosen label for the referring (child) term. It &#8216;reads&#8217; rather nicely in Fig. 8b2, though less so in 8b3. Any other label can be used too, like &#8220;it&#8221; or &#8220;these&#8221;.
</span></span>),
which points with a coreference connector to the parent. This isolates the parent&#8217;s meaning and transfers it onto the child, unidirectionally. Finally, one can use this child term &#8220;them&#8221; for building the rest of the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence, e.g. by connecting it to &#8220;half-of&#8221; and &#8220;escape&#8221;. The coreference connector points from the further-enriched child to its isolated, meaning-providing parent.</p>
<p>In <strong>case 3</strong> (Fig. 8b3), the same reasoning is applied: here one first constructs an isolated &#8220;half-of dogs&#8221;, then one limits that conceptual unit of dogs to those being black, and specifies that they escape. Note that one can still further specify the isolated part, as in e.g.: &#8216;black ones of: some female half-of dogs&#8217;.</p>
<p><img class="i80" src="img/Fig8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Figure 8. Interchangeable vs. non-interchangeable attributes.</b>
In (a), attribute order does not matter. But in advanced cases, the order in which multiple connections are added to a term can affect meaning. Here, the attributes &#8220;half-of&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; can be applied either (b1)&nbsp;simultaneously, or (b2-3)&nbsp;in a particular order. In the latter cases, one applies the first connection to the term &#8220;dogs&#8221;, then isolates that concept as parent for a coreferencing child placeholder, that is e.g. labeled &#8216;them&#8217;, and one then further connects this child.</p>
<hr />
<p>Notes (which may go a bit too deep for a first reading) :</p>
<p>&bull; The implicit relation between &#8220;dogs&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; would be automatically inferable to be &#8220;limited-to-all-those-having-color&#8221; (and not just &#8220;having-color&#8221;), because black would be classified as a color, and dogs represents not just one dog, but a group of dogs.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">32</span><span class="popx popup">
 A note on how to create the meaning of some &#8216;group of dogs&#8217;, starting from a single &#8220;dog&#8221; concept.
 <br />Consider a bident-based construct like &#8220;11 dog&#8221;, or stated explicitly: &#8220;dog &lt;has-amount&gt; 11&#8243;. The association with the relation &#8220;has-amount&#8221; is what converts the meaning of &#8220;dog&#8221; into a group. That is how that relation would work, i.e. how it would have to be semantically interpreted.
</span></span>Alternatively, this relation could be made explicit, but for this example&#8217;s brevity and focus we used an implicit relation. Similarly, &#8220;half-of&#8221; pertains to the group of dogs, so it does not create the meaning of half of one dog.</p>
<p>&bull; Each &#8220;half-of&#8221; creates an <em>unspecified</em> subset that is some half of the group. So in case 1 where &#8220;black&#8221; also specifies that this half subset consists of only black dogs, and in Fig. 8b where more than half of the dogs are black, the final subset remains partly unspecified. Therefore we had to choose an arbitrary subset of black dogs in Fig. 8b1. This is consistent with the other two cases, where the &#8216;half&#8217; (dark blue line) is also not further specified and thus had to be chosen arbitrarily in Fig. 8b2-3.</p>
<p>&bull; In natural language one can imply multiple pieces of information simultaneously. For example, a phrase like &#8216;<em>the</em> black half of dogs escapes&#8217; would not only express the information of case 1, but also tell that (an other) &#8220;half-of dogs not has-color black&#8221;<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">33</span><span class="popx popup">
 Here &#8220;has-color&#8221; would be attached (as subject) with a relation-less bident to &#8220;not&#8221; (as object).
</span></span><span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">34</span><span class="popx popup">
 [Advanced note]: One might think of representing this as &#8220;exactly half-of dogs has-color black&#8221;, instead, inspired by a similar expression in natural language. However, natural language is ambiguous.
 <br />- The primary meaning of &#8220;exactly&#8221; is: exact, as in not more nor less than the stated amount; (in contrast to &#8220;around&#8221;, which defines uncertainty about the exactness of the amount).
 <br />- A secondary meaning would imply, or intend to incorporate a meaning like: for the other part of the group, the opposite of what is said is true. This is what &#8220;exactly&#8221;&#8216;s meaning would have to be linked to in that sentence. (And from that, an algorithm could infer that &#8220;half&#8209;of dogs  not  has&#8209;color  black&#8221;, which is the additional information we proposed in the main text).
 <br /><br />It is up to a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box&#8217;s term-provider whether or not to include such intricate, compacted meanings.
 <br /><br />In any case, when dealing with concepts that represent groups, curators will need to learn to pay attention to ambiguities in natural language. Or at least they should interpret <span class="caps">VSM</span> expressions like &#8220;exactly half&#8209;of&#8221; in a plain, literal way. With the primary meaning, it would quite simply express &#8220;half&#8209;of &lt;has&#8209;precision&gt; exact&#8221;, i.e. &#8216;a/some exact half&#8217;.
</span></span>,

Also here, the &#8216;new me&#8217; is first contextually isolated, before being referred to again with the extra adjective.

<h2>3. Additional functionality</h2>
<p>While terms and connectors provide the core functionality of <span class="caps">VSM</span>, some additional features can further raise both the usability and expressivity of <span class="caps">VSM</span>. We built some of these functions into our prototype UI already, while some others are initial ideas that can be further developed.</p>
<p><a name="templates"></a></p>
<h4>3.1. Templates</h4>
<div class="shortstory">
<h5>The Short Story <span class="ssr">5/5</span></h5>
<p>How can we make <span class="caps">VSM</span> immediately support the way how people are working today?
Because people often search through scientific literature for one type of information (initially at least),
and then enter it repetitively into a spreadsheet or database form.</p>
<p>Just like you&#8217;d expect: with <em><span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates</em>: these are partial, pre-constructed <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>&#8230; with empty fields where a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term can be filled in:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates imitate spreadsheet rows or entry forms. But in addition they offer a convenient autocomplete
(which is quicker and less error-prone that spreadsheets),
with each field linked to its own, particular set of term dictionaries.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">36</span><span class="popx popup">
 Each dictionary (or Controlled Vocabulary, CV) is a list of terms or words, with an agreed-upon meaning and definition, within a particular topic.
 <br /><br />Note for experts:&nbsp; In our prototype UI, we can specify a number of &#8220;preferred <acronym title="Controlled Vocabulary"><span class="caps">CV</span></acronym> s&#8221; for each empty field.
 Terms from those CVs are then conveniently ranked on top of the autocomplete suggestion list. &#8211; Alternatively,
 one may want to configure the template-UI to leave less flexibility,
 and to require that users enter terms only from a specific CV.
</span></span>And they offer an intuitive clarity of what to fill in where, because of the readable &#8216;sentence&#8217; format.
Our test-users literally loved all this.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">37</span><span class="popx popup">
 Isn&#8217;t it funny that &#8216;literally&#8217; has become a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/misuse-of-literally">figuratively</a> used expression? &mdash; But really,
 our test-users would be horrified if they had to go back to the technology they used before <span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates.
 <br /><br />They described this new curation technology &#8211; <span class="caps">VSM</span> &#8211; and
 what could be done automatically for them as a result,
 as being a real time&#8209;saver, and even as &#8216;Magic!&#8217;.
</span></span></p>
<p><br />What you may not expect (compared to current technology), is that <span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates are still extensible!
<br />Just like for any other <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence, you can always add extra context details: just add or insert new terms and connect them up:</p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img class="i65 imgl vsm" src="img/vsm06-8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><br />Boom!
<br />Now we have a curation technology that works just like what exists, but is better at the same time (with term lookup, and with clear visualization of what terms further specify what other terms),
and that is immediately extensible to its full power!
<br />So <span class="caps">VSM</span> is: easy to use, extremely flexible, and ready to be computed upon! Exactly what we <a href="intro#new-tech">wanted</a>.

<h5>The Full Story</h5>
<p>While <span class="caps">VSM</span> enables flexible information capture, some curation tasks involve the repetitive entry of similarly structured facts. To streamline a routine entry of facts, one can envision a <strong><span class="caps">VSM</span>-template</strong>. This is a predefined structure of connectors, with a series of terms, and empty fields that need to be filled in with a term by the user. &ndash; In a typical curation project, template designers would accompany a template with set of curation guidelines. These describe what type of term is expected in empty fields, in addition to how to interpret text in relevant scientific literature (which requires the most effort). Note that <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences (and -templates) can closely resemble natural language, which makes it clear for the curator to know what to fill in where. This makes the effort it takes to interact with the data entry software minimal.</p>
<p>Fig. 9 shows a number of templates. Each empty field can be associated with one or more preferred dictionaries, e.g. genes or cell types. This can help the autocomplete function to either rank these terms easily accessible on top, or display these terms only. Curators need not be restricted to capture only what a template was designed for: since a template is just a partial <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence, they can still insert any extra terms and connect them to the rest of the structure. For broader curation tasks, a curation platform could provide access to several <span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates in a menu, each dedicated to a particular information type that the curator may want to capture from a paper. The software may even enable users to design new templates.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Figure 9. <span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates.</b>
In the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-template in (a), the first two empty fields would be associated with protein terms, and the third one expects cell types and cell lines, which this template also clarifies in grey text. (b) is an example of this template filled in, and the result is a normal <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence. &#40;c) is a template where the main relation is easily selectable from a list of pre-associated, one-click terms; and the last empty field would limit its term-lookup to a controlled vocabulary of experiment types.</p>
<p><a name="external-coreference"></a></p>
<h4>3.2. External coreference</h4>
<p>In natural language, one can build a story by referring back to any concept that was conveyed in an earlier sentence (e.g. &#8216;John buys cheese&#8217;; &#8216;One hour after <em>that</em>, a mouse eats it&#8217;). Because each term in a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence is a specific concept, one can refer back to any of them; and not only from within a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence but from other <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences as well. Software for managing multiple <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences could support such coreferencing between sentences, visually or through internal IDs. This could for instance be used for unambiguously defining the steps of biological experiment protocols.</p>
<p><a name="head"></a></p>
<h4>3.3. Head</h4>
<p>As explained earlier, each term receives extra &#8216;context&#8217; from all its connected terms. As a consequence, every term actually represents the entire content of the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence, although from its own &#8216;perspective&#8217;: e.g. in Fig. 2b the fifth term can be read as &#8216;the fork used for eating of chicken by John&#8217;. In natural language though, a sentence conveys information only from one particular perspective, e.g. in Fig. 2b, the sentence implies focus on &#8216;the eating&#8217;. This perspective or &#8216;intended meaning&#8217; is embedded in the term &#8220;eats&#8221;; and this term is also the one that subsequent sentences would refer to when stating e.g. &#8220;<em>that</em> was observed in 2020&#8243;. The <span class="caps">VSM</span> UI could enable a user to assign this &#8216;focal term&#8217; or &#8216;head&#8217; in a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence via an Alt+click on or above the term, and draw dashes above the term and under the connectors.</p>
<p>Next, when one wants to refer to a sentence as a whole, e.g. for adding meta-information, software could automatically make an external coreference toward this intended term.</p>

<p><a name="term-types"></a></p>
<h4>3.4. General and Data terms</h4>
<p>As <span class="caps">VSM</span> terms are embedded into a particular context, they represent specific concepts. Ontologies, however, define relations between general concepts, i.e. concepts that are not bound to a particular context. In addition, <span class="caps">RDF</span> is able to work with literal text-strings or data, which do not represent any &#8216;concept&#8217;. In order to support all these three fundamentally different types, the <span class="caps">VSM</span> UI may let the user change a term&#8217;s type between specific, general, or data (via Ctrl+click); and then shows them with a different background color. Then, a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence could express information like &#8220;duck [in general] is-a-type-of bird [in general] according-to ontology-version-X [specific]&#8221;, or &#8220;bird [in general] has 2 wings&#8221;, or &#8220;chicken [in general] has-alias hen [literal string]&#8221;, or &#8220;proteinX has-sequence <span class="caps">MRHIAHTQ</span> [literal,&nbsp;data]&#8221;.</p>
<p>In fact, the distinction between general and specific concepts is described in 📖 <strong><span class="caps">VSM</span> Principle 4</strong>,
but we can explain that much better after we show a picture of VSMGraphs, later on the <a href="vsmgraph">VSMGraphs</a> page.</p>
<p>Note that in case one would use <span class="caps">VSM</span> as an interface to generate <span class="caps">RDF</span> or <span class="caps">OWL</span> models, <span class="caps">VSM</span> does not impose the use of either <span class="caps">OWL</span> Instances or <span class="caps">OWL</span> Classes.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">38</span><span class="popx popup">
 In the <span class="caps">VSM</span> view, the only difference between (<span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s) <em>specific</em> and <em>general</em>
 is whether a concept is thought of as being attached to any <em>explicit or implicit context</em>, or <em>not</em>, respectively.
</span></span>Still, it makes sense to translate (the default, specific) <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms to <span class="caps">OWL</span> Instances, as bioscience findings are typically reported only under particular experimental conditions or biological context.</p>
<p>A further treatise on the meaning of general vs. specific concepts in <span class="caps">VSM</span>, a topic that covers the subject of semantics alone, falls outside the scope of this page and will be discussed <a href="vsmgraph">later</a>. The focus of this page is to present <span class="caps">VSM</span> as a user-oriented method for the construction of any contextualized knowledge; a method that is founded on <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s well-defined and human-thought inspired semantics, and reflected in a robust, intuitive, and general-purpose UI design.</p>

 To use a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box in a real application, it must be linked to some dictionary/ies, e.g. some of the many available
 biological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Biomedical_Ontologies">Ontologies</a>
 (like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25214827">on</a> <a href="https://bioportal.bioontology.org/">BioPortal</a>)
 or  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary">Controlled Vocabularies</a> (CV).
 <br>Also, these CVs are often incomplete works-in-progress, so you may need to create extra terms, or even new dictionaries, for your research field.
 <br>It is an essential step anyway for communicating with colleagues, to agree on what words mean what!
 Building an agreed-upon dictionary just formalizes this process and creates a common work of reference.

 Here we discuss features for the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box UI that are either implemented or that are ideas for customization options or extensions. We refer to the <a href="https://github.com/vsm">&#8216;vsm&#8217; organization</a> on GitHub (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-box">vsm-box</a>) to follow up on which features are currently available.
 <br>Note: the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box UI embedded in the Short Stories here and on the Examples page, is just the prototype.
 <br>The <a href="https://vsm.github.io/demo">vsm demo</a> page includes the refactored, &#8216;production ready&#8217; vsm-box user-interface component.

 &bull; I like to say that they are different &#8216;avatars&#8217;: i.e.  manifestations, appearances, different lexical forms that represents the same thing.
 (Much more about that in The Full Story).
 <br>&bull; <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms for &#8220;with&#8221; / &#8220;using&#8221; / &#8220;uses&#8221; / &#8230; would in fact all have the same ID.
 <br>So it makes no difference for a computer&#8217;s understanding which form you choose. Still, by choosing the form that we&#8217;d expect to see in e.g. English,
 we can create <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences that are much easier to read for humans.
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">11</span>
 A note to impatient knowledge-representation experts: this intuitive description will become elegantly rigorous during the Full Story sections.
 <br>Note #2: The John-holds-tomato case is shown as a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence later, on the Examples page.
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">12</span>
 In fact, we are able to make it <i>resemble</i> natural language, because we are <i>able/allowed</i> to make <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms <i>appear</i> as conjugated verbs, nouns, prepositions, etc.
 <br>That ensures that we can keep complex information (i.e. longer sentences) easily readable for us, humans, too.
 <br>Computers do not understand conjugations etc. reliably well, so we need to clarify the structure of a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence in another way.

 <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors show the conceptual structure that exists in the information explicitly.
 <br>As a result, <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms&#8217; text can show a readable <strong>formulation</strong>, while <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms&#8217; IDs and the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors show the <strong>conceptualization</strong> structure that exists in the information, intuitively and clearly.
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">14</span>
 An <i>indirect</i> object must be captured via an extra relation; e.g. &#8216;Ann gives Eve X&#8217; as &#8216;Ann gives X <span class="undl">to</span> Eve&#8217;.
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">15</span>
 In <span class="caps">RDF</span> one typically makes a <i>reification</i> construct in order to point to a relation; i.e. one creates an additional <i>entity</i> (a <i>blank node</i>) that represents that <i>relation</i> (or in fact, its entire triple), that one can then point to. Because <span class="caps">RDF</span> treats <i>relations</i> as fundamentally different things than <i>entities</i>.
 <br>(For an overview of four approaches or proposals for referring to relations in <span class="caps">RDF</span>, see ref: &#8220;Hernández D, et al. Reifying <span class="caps">RDF</span>: What works well with Wikidata?, <span class="caps">ISWC</span>, 2015&#8243;).
 <br>In fact Principle 2, pertaining to relations, is similar to the <i>n-ary relations</i> approach in <span class="caps">RDF</span>, if that would be applied consistently to all relations (except for a few <i>primitive</i> relations like has-subject/object/etc., which is what the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors actually represent).
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">16</span>
 Principle 2 is crucial, so we repeat it once more in other words:
 <br>Only when some trident attaches to a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term with its relation-leg, only then is the term made to be seen as a relation. And then only so, under that one trident, i.e. locally in that one triple subunit.
 <br>What <span class="caps">RDF</span> (or formal logic) typically view as a relation (or <i>predicate</i>), <span class="caps">VSM</span> views only <strong>locally as a relation</strong> (under a particular connector, in one subunit) and views it elsewhere as an entity / as &#8216;reified&#8217; / as a noun.
 <br><span class="smaller">(The <span class="caps">RDF</span> phrase &#8216;re-ified&#8217;, based on Latin, means &#8216;thing-ified&#8217; or &#8216;made into an object&#8217;).</span>
 <br>This was an essential, necessary step for designing <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s expressivity and simplicity in what will follow:
 <br>think of <strong>all</strong> <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms as nouns / &#8216;thingified&#8217; concepts / something that one can always refer to or mentally point to again. Like this, one can immediately refer to any <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term, always in the same way.
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">17</span>
 Some more ways to say this:&nbsp;
 &#8216;each term <em>is placed in the context of</em> / accumulates extra context-meaning from all others&#8217;, or:&nbsp;
 &#8216;all connected <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms <em>enrich</em> each other&#8217;s meaning&#8217;.
 <br>This context meaning is shared with indirectly connected <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms too.
 <br>In the example, even the term &#8220;in&#8221; now specifically represents &#8216;the being located in C of the A-B-activation&#8217;.
 This is really useful. Because then you can say more about <em>that</em> concept again.
 For example: &#8216;that being-located in&#8230;&#8217; is only &#8220;probable&#8221;. Then we can form the sentence: &#8220;A activates B probably in C&#8221;.

 Easy to read: relative to the complexity of the information. &#8211; And of course (just like natural language) relative to the reader&#8217;s knowledge of the research field.
 <br>To quote one of our curators:
 <br>&#8220;From a user&#8217;s side, I don&#8217;t think that complexity is difficult to handle at all.
 <br>In fact, I&#8217;m excited about all the <em>complexity we can now handle</em> in such an elegant manner.
 <br>It allows us to focus on the biology; no more need to worry about the entry format so much.&#8221;

 (as in: generated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining">text-mining</a> algorithm).
 Because they look a bit like it. &#8211; He later admitted he had been answering an email during the presentation, though.

 <b>The notion of <i>local context</i> in <span class="caps">VSM</span></b> differs from <i>context</i> in e.g. Conceptual Graphs (CG) or <span class="caps">RDF</span> Named Graphs, which take a <i>formal logic</i> based starting-point for representing meaning.
 <br>&bull; Their <i>context</i> can be seen as a <i>separate</i> object that is <i>shared</i> among a group of concepts, in order to manage the scope of logical quantifiers. (<span class="undd">CG</span>: Sowa JF, &#8220;Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine&#8221;, 1984; <span class="undd"><span class="caps">RDF</span></span>: Caroll JJ, &#8220;Named Graphs&#8221;, 2005).
 <br>&bull; In contrast, <span class="caps">VSM</span> starts from an association-based viewpoint, which is instrumental for prioritizing different objectives.

 While Principle 2 defines the nature or meaning of individual <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms, Principle 3 defines how the meaning of each of them changes by attaching connectors to them.
 <br>Note that at this point, Principle 3 may be intuitive or even seem trivial for simple cases like Fig. 2.
 But it provides a crucial way of thinking for handling cases that need the coreference connector (sections 2.5 and 2.6).

 <br>One could also enter &#8220;activation&nbsp; <strong>of</strong> &nbsp;B&#8221;, by using an explicit <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term &#8220;<strong>of</strong>&#8220;, which would have the meta-meaning &#8216;has&nbsp;object&#8217;.
 <br>Note #2: please do not misunderstand and think that &#8216;VSM knows&#8217; if two sentences (two graph structures) would represent a same, rephrased meaning.
 <span class="caps">VSM</span> does not &#8216;know&#8217;. <span class="caps">VSM</span> is just a <em>representation form</em>,
 to be used by people and algorithms. &#8211; Just
 like &#8216;English does not know&#8217; what you mean. Your brain does, and it uses English to represent information at some level.

 This figure also shows that <b>numbers can be represented with <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms</b>. This makes sense because one &#8220;5&#8243; can be conceptually different from another &#8220;5&#8243;; because just like other <span class="caps">VSM</span>-terms, a numeric concept can be embedded in a particular context. For example, one could be an &#8220;approximately&nbsp; 5&#8243;, another a &#8220;5 &nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp; 2&#8243;, and another could be contextually specified or modified to mean &#8220;at-least&nbsp; 5&#8243;.
 <br>For this, the autocomplete system needs to support the entry of numeric concepts. But there are infinitely many of them possible, so they cannot be stored in any prepared vocabulary. So the autocomplete will need to automatically generate an ID + term-label for any of them as needed, based on some pattern and on what the user is typing.
 <br>(This was not yet implemented in the prototype used on this web page, but is now supported via the &#8216;<a href="https://github.com/vsm">vsm</a>&#8216; GitHub-project&#8217;s modules:
 <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-dictionary">vsm-dictionary</a> (see its <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-dictionary/blob/master/Dictionary.spec.md">spec</a>),
 which supports <a href="https://github.com/vsm/vsm-box">vsm-box</a>).
 <br>Other numeric concepts like dates or timestamps could similarly be provided to the user. For this, additional dictionary software-modules that generate such concepts should be easy to implement.

 A note on how to create the meaning of some &#8216;group of dogs&#8217;, starting from a single &#8220;dog&#8221; concept.
 <br>Consider a bident-based construct like &#8220;11 dog&#8221;, or stated explicitly: &#8220;dog &lt;has-amount&gt; 11&#8243;. The association with the relation &#8220;has-amount&#8221; is what converts the meaning of &#8220;dog&#8221; into a group. That is how that relation would work, i.e. how it would have to be semantically interpreted.
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">33</span>
 Here &#8220;has-color&#8221; would be attached (as subject) with a relation-less bident to &#8220;not&#8221; (as object).
</li>
<li class="item"><span class="nr">34</span>
 [Advanced note]: One might think of representing this as &#8220;exactly half-of dogs has-color black&#8221;, instead, inspired by a similar expression in natural language. However, natural language is ambiguous.
 <br>- The primary meaning of &#8220;exactly&#8221; is: exact, as in not more nor less than the stated amount; (in contrast to &#8220;around&#8221;, which defines uncertainty about the exactness of the amount).
 <br>- A secondary meaning would imply, or intend to incorporate a meaning like: for the other part of the group, the opposite of what is said is true. This is what &#8220;exactly&#8221;&#8216;s meaning would have to be linked to in that sentence. (And from that, an algorithm could infer that &#8220;half&#8209;of dogs  not  has&#8209;color  black&#8221;, which is the additional information we proposed in the main text).
 <br>It is up to a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-box&#8217;s term-provider whether or not to include such intricate, compacted meanings.
 <br>In any case, when dealing with concepts that represent groups, curators will need to learn to pay attention to ambiguities in natural language. Or at least they should interpret <span class="caps">VSM</span> expressions like &#8220;exactly half&#8209;of&#8221; in a plain, literal way. With the primary meaning, it would quite simply express &#8220;half&#8209;of &lt;has&#8209;precision&gt; exact&#8221;, i.e. &#8216;a/some exact half&#8217;.

 The issue of non-interchangeable connections was first noticed when the designer of <span class="caps">VSM</span> heard someone talk about their &#8216;<em>old</em> new me&#8217; vs. &#8216;<em>new</em> new me&#8217;. Also here, the &#8216;new me&#8217; is first contextually isolated, before being referred to again with the extra adjective.

 Each dictionary (or Controlled Vocabulary, CV) is a list of terms or words, with an agreed-upon meaning and definition, within a particular topic.
 <br>Note for experts:&nbsp; In our prototype UI, we can specify a number of &#8220;preferred <acronym title="Controlled Vocabulary"><span class="caps">CV</span></acronym> s&#8221; for each empty field.
 Terms from those CVs are then conveniently ranked on top of the autocomplete suggestion list. &#8211; Alternatively,
 one may want to configure the template-UI to leave less flexibility,
 and to require that users enter terms only from a specific CV.

 Isn&#8217;t it funny that &#8216;literally&#8217; has become a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/misuse-of-literally">figuratively</a> used expression? &mdash; But really,
 our test-users would be horrified if they had to go back to the technology they used before <span class="caps">VSM</span>-templates.
 <br>They described this new curation technology &#8211; <span class="caps">VSM</span> &#8211; and
 what could be done automatically for them as a result,
 as being a real time&#8209;saver, and even as &#8216;Magic!&#8217;.

 In the <span class="caps">VSM</span> view, the only difference between (<span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s) <em>specific</em> and <em>general</em>
 is whether a concept is thought of as being attached to any <em>explicit or implicit context</em>, or <em>not</em>, respectively.

 Gene Ontology (<a href="http://www.geneontology.org">geneontology.org</a>) includes a dictionary (controlled vocabulary) of terms about gene functionality etc. &#8211; Example of a long term:
 &#8220;<a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045944">positive regulation of transcription from <span class="caps">RNA</span> polymerase II promoter</a>&#8220;, many are longer. This length originates from GO being designed as a label-based classification system for biological concepts, resulting in a deep tree structure of ever-more-specific terminology.
