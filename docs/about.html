<p><br />In addition, <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/martin.kuiper">Martin Kuiper</a>
(Professor in <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/biology/research/molecular-systems-biology/systems-biology">Systems Biology</a>),
contributed with feedback and edits to the formal parts of the How <span class="caps">VSM</span> Works and the Discussion page.
He also took the role of afternoon sounding board during the evolution of ideas that formed <span class="caps">VSM</span>.
<br />Martin Kuiper, and then also <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/astrid.lagreid">Astrid Lægreid</a>,
created a friendly, interdisciplinary research environment, that led wet-lab biologists and computer specialists to sit together
and identify problems that could be addressed with combined expertise.</p>
<p>We are also indebted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianleitner/">Florian Leitner</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickantezana/">Erick Antezana</a>,
and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/runesaetre/">Rune Sætre</a>
for their feedback on and critical reading of the earlier, very different versions of the How <span class="caps">VSM</span> Works and Discussion texts. &#8211; We

thank scientists at the European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/"><span class="caps">EBI</span></a>)
and members of the International Society for Biocuration (<a href="http://www.biocurator.org/"><span class="caps">ISB</span></a>) for valuable discussions and suggestions.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">2</span><span class="popx popup"> Looking back to the beginning, I realize that at first we only had a rudimentary idea of how to explain <span class="caps">VSM</span>.

<h4>Funding Information</h4>
<p>First, the conception of the initial idea was supported by Funksjonell Genomforskning (<span class="caps">FUGE</span>) of Midt-Norge and <span class="caps">NTNU</span>.&nbsp; &#8211; &nbsp;Next,
it was then further developed and implemented solely by private, otherwise unfunded efforts
by Steven Vercruysse.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">3</span><span class="popx popup"> Yes&#8230; in today&#8217;s scientific funding system, you&#8217;re a temp forever. &#8211; And
  some years nothing at all, <span class=""><strong>if you dare to be passionate about your brainchild</strong></span>.
  <br />And this situation
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/let-researchers-try-new-paths-1.20857">is</a>,

  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/young-researchers-thrive-in-life-after-academia-1.20686">problem</a>.
   It&#8217;s also a strong push to move outside academia, to be less worried about one&#8217;s future.
   <br />Perhaps I should do that after sharing this project here! Unless we&#8217;re able to draw attention to <span class="caps">VSM</span>, to help us convince

   project reviewers&#8230;, or try our luck in industry.
</span></span>&nbsp; &#8211; &nbsp;Recently
the further application of this prototype was funded via the &#8216;Well-constructed Knowledge Commons&#8217; project
of The Research Council of Norway (<a href="https://www.forskningsradet.no"><span class="caps">NFR</span></a>). &nbsp; &#8211; &nbsp;For now, funding has ended again.</p>
<h4>Please support my further work on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/stevencruy">Patreon</a>  &nbsp;&#x2b05;</h4>
<h4>How we got here</h4>
<p>The foundation of <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s design was laid starting in 2008. By then it had become obvious, from many interactions with biologists,
that new methods for concerting their knowledge into some database format were dearly needed.
After we created <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s foundations, and despite many attempts to raise funding for implementing <span class="caps">VSM</span>,
we were unable to convince funding agencies of the importance of making research findings computable!</p>
<p>We therefore implemented a proof-of-concept <span class="caps">VSM</span> <acronym title="user interface"><span class="caps">UI</span></acronym> without funding.
We embedded it in a web application (<a href="scicura.html">SciCura v1</a>) and curators in our group were happy to test and use it.
This gave us a clearer insight into the nature of <span class="caps">VSM</span>, how to use it, and how to explain it to third parties while avoiding common misunderstandings.
This process was crucial for the text on this site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The development of  <span class="caps">VSM</span> is a demonstration of the difficulty encountered by young scientists
to mature their groundbreaking ideas into transformative implementations,
and calls for new modalities of project support by funding agencies.</p>
</blockquote>
