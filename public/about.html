<h4>Creator/s</h4>
<p><a href="http://stcruy.com">Steven Vercruysse</a> created most of this site&#8217;s text, all its figures, and embedded software.
<br />He is Researcher (PhD in Computational Biotechnology, MSc in Computer Science, MSc in Physics)
<br />

<p><br />In addition, <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/martin.kuiper">Martin Kuiper</a>
(Professor in <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/biology/research/molecular-systems-biology/systems-biology">Systems Biology</a>),
contributed with feedback and edits to an earlier, shorter and more formal version of text, which parts of this site are based on.
He also took the role of afternoon sounding board during the evolution of ideas that formed <span class="caps">VSM</span>.
<br />Martin Kuiper, and then also <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/astrid.lagreid">Astrid Lægreid</a>,
created a friendly, interdisciplinary research environment, that led wet-lab biologists and computer specialists to sit together
and identify problems that could be addressed with combined expertise.</p>

<p>We are also indebted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianleitner/">Florian Leitner</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickantezana/">Erick Antezana</a>,
and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/runesaetre/">Rune Sætre</a>
for their feedback on and critical reading of the earlier, very different versions of the shorter, much more formal text. &#8211; We
also thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heri-ramampiaro-1a86351/">Heri Ramampiaro</a>,

<a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/maria.k.andersen">Maria K Andersen</a> and others for comments throughout the conception of the ideas
and on earlier versions of that text. &#8211; We
thank scientists at the European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/"><span class="caps">EBI</span></a>)
and members of the International Society for Biocuration (<a href="http://www.biocurator.org/"><span class="caps">ISB</span></a>) for discussions and suggestions.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">2</span><span class="popx popup"> Looking back to the beginning, I realize that at first we only had a rudimentary idea of how to explain <span class="caps">VSM</span>.
<br />Florian&#8217;s, Erick&#8217;s and many dozens and dozens of others&#8217; input helped us improve many ways in which our earlier explanations were quite unclear.
And they helped us offset <span class="caps">VSM</span> much better against existing technology.
<br />Thank you all for bearing through that!

<h4>Funding Information</h4>
<p>First, the conception of the initial idea was supported by Funksjonell Genomforskning (<span class="caps">FUGE</span>) of Midt-Norge and <span class="caps">NTNU</span>.&nbsp; &#8211; &nbsp;Next,
it was then further developed and implemented solely by private, otherwise unfunded efforts
by Steven Vercruysse.<span class="note fun popupHolder"><span class="popx nr" onclick="return togglePopup(this)">3</span><span class="popx popup"> Yes&#8230; in today&#8217;s scientific funding system, you&#8217;re a temp forever. &#8211; And
  some years nothing at all, <span class=""><strong>if you dare to be passionate about your brainchild</strong></span>.
  <br />And this situation
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/let-researchers-try-new-paths-1.20857">is</a>,
  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/fewer-numbers-better-science-1.20858">quite</a>,

  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/young-researchers-thrive-in-life-after-academia-1.20686">problem</a>.
   It&#8217;s also a strong push to move outside academia, to be less worried about one&#8217;s future.
   <br />Perhaps I should do that after sharing this project here! Unless we&#8217;re able to draw attention to <span class="caps">VSM</span>, to help us convince
   <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forskningsradet.no%2Fno%2FNyheter%2FForskningsradet_bor_ta_mer_risiko%2F1253977676638&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url">risk&#8209;averse</a>
   project reviewers&#8230;, or try our luck in industry.
</span></span>&nbsp; &#8211; &nbsp;And
recently the further application of this prototype is funded through &#8216;Crossover Research 2.0: Well-constructed Knowledge Commons&#8217;
of The Research Council of Norway (<a href="https://www.forskningsradet.no"><span class="caps">NFR</span></a>).</p>
<h4>How we got here</h4>
<p>The foundation of <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s design was laid starting in 2009. By then it had become obvious, from many interactions with biologists,
that new methods for concerting their knowledge into some database format were dearly needed.
Despite many attempts to raise funding for implementing <span class="caps">VSM</span>,
we were unable to convince funding agencies of the importance of making research findings computable!</p>
<p>We therefore implemented a proof-of-concept <span class="caps">VSM</span> <acronym title="user interface"><span class="caps">UI</span></acronym> without funding.
We embedded it in a web application (<a href="scicura.html">SciCura v1</a>) and curators in our group were happy to test/use it.
This gave us a clearer insight into the nature of <span class="caps">VSM</span>, how to use it, and how to explain it to third parties while avoiding common misunderstandings.
This process was crucial for the text on this site.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The development of  <span class="caps">VSM</span> is a demonstration of the difficulty encountered by young scientists
to mature their groundbreaking ideas into transformative implementations,
and calls for new modalities of project support by funding agencies.</p>
