  <h2>6. &nbsp; VSMGraphs</h2>
<p class="smaller"><i>(This page is a stub, written some years before 2020.)</i></p>
<p><br />
VSMGraphs are a way to represent the content of one or multiple <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences in a single graph.
Loosely spoken, it&#8217;s a bit like an integration of &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_memory">semantic memory</a>&#8216; (like ontology-based classifications)
and &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory">episodic memory</a>&#8216; (specific facts, like <span class="caps">VSM</span>&#8216;s core functionality).</p>
<p>More text may follow later (based on a still-unpolished text I&#8217;ve written a while ago).</p>
<p><br />
<hr /></p>
<p class="smaller">But maybe you can already get the gist from this preview? :</p>
<p><img class="i60 vsm" src="img/vsmgraph-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
	<li class="smaller"><strong>Black nodes (round, triangle, square)</strong> represent &#8216;specific&#8217; or &#8216;context-embedded&#8217; concepts.
	<ul>
		<li class="smaller">Semantically, they are embedded in <em>explicit</em> (by their connected nodes) and <em>implicit</em> (simply not stated) context.</li>
		<li class="smaller">They are the concepts that are created by making a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence (by default).</li>
		<li class="smaller">They are linked in a way that reflects <span class="caps">VSM</span>-connectors (e.g. &#9679;&mdash;<sup>&#9650;</sup>&rarr;&#9679;, as <em>one</em> object that connects three nodes).</li>
		<li class="smaller">(The numbers are only there to make the graph less tangled).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li class="smaller"><strong>White nodes</strong> (there are only round ones) represent &#8216;general&#8217; or &#8216;context-free&#8217; concepts.
	<ul>
		<li class="smaller">Semantically, they are not embedded in any context (and are also not embedded so by connected terms).
They just represent &#8216;the idea&#8217; of a particular concept. &nbsp;E.g.: &#8216;Duck&#8217;, in general.</li>
		<li class="smaller">Every black node is <em>specified from</em> a white node, or from another black node
(a coreference sub-specifies it, adding extra (explicit and perhaps also implicit) context). &#8211; Specification is indicated with a double arrow: &#8608;.</li>
		<li class="smaller">So all <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences (represented as VSMGraphs) are built with newly created black nodes, that are all specified from the same set of available white nodes.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li class="smaller"><strong>Rectangle nodes</strong> represent &#8216;data&#8217;. This could e.g. be a &#8216;literal string&#8217; as label for a white node concept, or a protein sequence, or image data.
	<ul>
		<li><span class="smaller">How such raw data should be interpreted is indicated by any relation that connects to it, e.g. &#8220;has-jpeg-data&#8221;.</span></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li class="smaller">The colored areas only serve to illustrate node functionality groups here:
	<ul>
		<li class="smaller">The <strong>blue area</strong> highlights one <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence.</li>
		<li class="smaller">The <strong>yellow area</strong> highlights general, dictionary concepts. These would be shared between all <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences. (And they could be categorized in a hierarchy).</li>
		<li class="smaller">The <strong>green area</strong> highlights the terms / labels for the dictionary concepts.</li>
		<li class="smaller">The <strong>red area</strong> is just for a few utility terms (&#8220;has-term&#8221; and &#8220;is specified to <i>be</i>&#8220;).</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p class="smaller"><br />Here&#8217;s another one : &nbsp;(the grey-shaded areas highlight two <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentences&#8217; individual subgraphs,
 which are connected by a coreference between the two) :</p>
<p><img class="i60 vsm" src="img/vsmgraph-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><br /><hr /><br /></p>
<p>And since we promised <a href="vsm#term-types">earlier</a> that we&#8217;d explain this after a picture of a VSMGraph, here is:</p>
<p><a name="principle-4"></a>
<br /></p>
<p>📖 <strong><span class="caps">VSM</span> Principle 4.</strong> <i>General vs. specific concepts.</i></p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>general concepts</strong> are free from any &#8216;context&#8217;, while</li>
	<li><strong>specific concepts</strong> are placed into an <strong>&#8216;<span class="undl">implicit</span> context&#8217;</strong>, and</li>
	<li><em>some</em> of their implicit context is <strong>made <span class="undl">explicit</span></strong> via tridents/bidents and list connectors.</li>
	<li>A coreference&#8217;d child inherits all of this context from its parent;
except that <em>some more</em> of its context is made explicit, via its own connected terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s elaborate on each:
<br />1.&nbsp; A General Concept is a &#8216;general idea/understanding&#8217; of something that we can have in our minds.
For example, the concept of <em>Duck</em>, in general, is not any specific duck.
So meaning-wise, it&#8217;s not &#8216;placed&nbsp;in&#8217; any &#8216;context&#8217; (which would make it specific) at all.</p>
<p>2+3.&nbsp; A Specific Concept, however, is one that we have mentally placed into some &#8216;context&#8217;
(i.e. associated &#8216;things/meanings&#8217; that make the concept a particular thing).
Now, it is important to realize that this &#8216;context&#8217; consists of two parts.
Most obviously, there is <em>explicit context</em>: this comes from all what is connected to the concept in a <span class="caps">VSM</span>-sentence, through tridents/bidents and list connectors.
But there is also <em>implicit context</em>: all the other things that aren&#8217;t said explicitly about it, and many of which we may not even know!
<br />Just think about this example. When I tell you about a particular caffeine molecule that I observed in a biochemical experiment,
then I may describe which molecule I meant, e.g.: one that was bound to some receptor in the brain.
But I didn&#8217;t mention, nor do I often even know, some other context details that are implicitly attached to it, but that still make it particular.
For example, what exact location in the brain was the receptor? Were any other molecules possibly interacting with the caffeine?
And even more in detail, what isotopes of carbon did the caffeine consist of?
And even history-like context like: who produced the caffeine molecule/s (maybe it had impurities that influenced my experiment)?
Was it stored correctly? Who prepped it? Etc.
<br />All these things are what make up any specific <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term&#8217;s implicit context. They are absent details,
but they are still what make the <span class="caps">VSM</span>-term a &#8216;specific thing&#8217; in our minds. &#8211; So,
a specific concept is always embedded in lots of unspecified, &#8216;implicit context&#8217;.
<br /><span class="smaller"> &ndash; (This is what we also explained, in a bit ad-hoc manner,
<a href="examples#bidents-numbers">in that section</a> on the Examples page).</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; When you look at VSMGraphs, you may see that there can be hierarchies of concepts with more and more context:
from general concept (white node), down to specific concept (black node), down to a coreferenced, more-specific child-concept (also black)
(I like to call this: <em>sub-specification</em> of a concept), and so on.
So if you&#8217;d build a story around some concepts, then you&#8217;d create chains of sub-specified concepts that get consecutively embedded into ever-more explicit context.
(Like: attached details, or a growing history we&#8217;re learning about it).
For example: Arnold woke up one morning. Then <em>he</em> saved the world. (Now the <em>he</em> is a concept of which we also already know that it woke up that morning).
Then <em>he</em> jumped into a pool of lava. (Now <em>he</em> is subspecified again, and has again more explicit context attached). Etc.&nbsp; &#8211; So
there is always opportunity to make a specific concept ever-more specified.</p>
